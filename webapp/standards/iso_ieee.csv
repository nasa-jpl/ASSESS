It specifies requirements for the service provider to plan, establish, implement, operate, monitor, review, maintain and improve an SMS. The requirements include the design, transition, delivery and improvement of services to fulfil service requirements. This part of ISO/IECŒæ20000 can be used by:a) an organization seeking services from service providers and requiring assurance that their service requirements will be fulfilled;b) an organization that requires a consistent approach by all its service providers, including those in a supply chain;c) a service provider that intends to demonstrate its capability for the design, transition, delivery and improvement of services that fulfil service requirements;d) a service provider to monitor, measure and review its service management processes and services;e) a service provider to improve the design, transition and delivery of services through effective implementation and operation of an SMS;f) an assessor or auditor as the criteria for a conformity assessment of a service provider's SMS to the requirements in this part of ISO/IECŒæ20000.FigureŒæ2 illustrates an SMS, including the service management processes. The service management processes and the relationships between the processes can be implemented in different ways by different service providers. The nature of the relationship between a service provider and the customer will influence how the service management processes are implemented.FigureŒæ2äóîService management system1.2ŒæŒæŒæApplicationAll requirements in this part of ISO/IECŒæ20000 are generic and are intended to be applicable to all service providers, regardless of type, size and the nature of the services delivered. Exclusion of any of the requirements in ClausesŒæ4 to 9 is not acceptable when a service provider claims conformity to this part of ISO/IECŒæ20000, irrespective of the nature of the service provider's organization.Conformity to the requirements in ClauseŒæ4 can only be demonstrated by a service provider showing evidence of fulfilling all of the requirements in ClauseŒæ4. A service provider cannot rely on evidence of the governance of processes operated by other parties for the requirements in ClauseŒæ4.Conformity to the requirements in ClausesŒæ5 to 9 can be demonstrated by the service provider showing evidence of fulfilling all requirements. Alternatively, the service provider can show evidence of fulfilling the majority of the requirements themselves and evidence of the governance of processes operated by other parties for those processes, or parts of processes, that the service provider does not operate directly.The scope of this part of ISO/IECŒæ20000 excludes the specification for a product or tool. However, organizations can use this part of ISO/IECŒæ20000 to help them develop products or tools that support the operation of an SMS.NOTE ISO/IEC TRŒæ20000-3 provides guidance on scope definition and applicability of this part of ISO/IECŒæ20000. This includes further explanation about the governance of processes operated by other parties.",,ISO/IEC 20000-1:2011(en),"IntroductionThe requirements in this part of ISO/IECŒæ20000 include the design, transition, delivery and improvement of services that fulfil service requirements and provide value for both the customer and the service provider. This part of ISO/IECŒæ20000 requires an integrated process approach when the service provider plans, establishes, implements, operates, monitors, reviews, maintains and improves a service management system (SMS).Co-ordinated integration and implementation of an SMS provides ongoing control and opportunities for continual improvement, greater effectiveness and efficiency. The operation of processes as specified in this part of ISO/IECŒæ20000 requires personnel to be well organized and co-ordinated. Appropriate tools can be used to enable the processes to be effective and efficient.The most effective service providers consider the impact on the SMS through all stages of the service lifecycle, from strategy through design, transition and operation, including continual improvement.This part of ISO/IECŒæ20000 requires the application of the methodology known as äóìPlan-Do-Check-Actäóù (PDCA) to all parts of the SMS and the services. The PDCA methodology, as applied in this part of ISO/IECŒæ20000, can be briefly described as follows.Plan: establishing, documenting and agreeing the SMS. The SMS includes the policies, objectives, plans and processes to fulfil the service requirements.Do: implementing and operating the SMS for the design, transition, delivery and improvement of the services.Check: monitoring, measuring and reviewing the SMS and the services against the policies, objectives, plans and service requirements and reporting the results.Act: taking actions to continually improve performance of the SMS and the services.When used within an SMS, the following are the most important aspects of an integrated process approach and the PDCA methodology:a) understanding and fulfilling the service requirements to achieve customer satisfaction;b) establishing the policy and objectives for service management;c) designing and delivering services based on the SMS that add value for the customer;d) monitoring, measuring and reviewing performance of the SMS and the services;e) continually improving the SMS and the services based on objective measurements.FigureŒæ1 illustrates how the PDCA methodology can be applied to the SMS, including the service management processes specified in ClausesŒæ5 to 9, and the services. Each element of the PDCA methodology is a vital part of a successful implementation of an SMS. The improvement process used in this part of ISO/IECŒæ20000 is based on the PDCA methodology.FigureŒæ1äóîPDCA methodology applied to service managementThis part of ISO/IECŒæ20000 enables a service provider to integrate its SMS with other management systems in the service provider's organization. The adoption of an integrated process approach and the PDCA methodology enables the service provider to align or fully integrate multiple management system standards. For example, an SMS can be integrated with a quality management system based on ISOŒæ9001 or an information security management system based on ISO/IECŒæ27001.ISO/IECŒæ20000 is intentionally independent of specific guidance. The service provider can use a combination of generally accepted guidance and its own experience.Users of an International Standard are responsible for its correct application. An International Standard does not purport to include all necessary statutory and regulatory requirements and contractual obligations of the service provider. Conformity to an International Standard does not of itself confer immunity from statutory and regulatory requirements.For the purposes of research on service management standards, users are encouraged to share their views on ISO/IECŒæ20000-1 and their priorities for changes to the rest of the ISO/IECŒæ20000 series.

This includes in particular the following:äóî central and distributed process control, monitoring and automation technology as well as information systems used for their operation, such as programming and parameterization devices;äóî digital controllers and automation components such as control and field devices or Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs), including digital sensor and actuator elements;äóî all further supporting information systems used in the process control domain, e.g. for supplementary data visualization tasks and for controlling, monitoring, data archiving, historian logging, reporting and documentation purposes;äóî communication technology used in the process control domain, e.g. networks, telemetry, telecontrol applications and remote control technology;äóî Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) components, e.g. smart meters;äóî measurement devices, e.g. for emission values;äóî digital protection and safety systems, e.g. protection relays, safety PLCs, emergency governor mechanisms;äóî energy management systems, e.g. of Distributed Energy Resources (DER), electric charging infrastructures, in private households, residential buildings or industrial customer installations;äóî distributed components of smart grid environments, e.g. in energy grids, in private households, residential buildings or industrial customer installations;äóî all software, firmware and applications installed on above-mentioned systems, e.g. DMS (Distribution Management System) applications or OMS (Outage Management System);äóî any premises housing the above-mentioned equipment and systems;äóî remote maintenance systems for above-mentioned systems.This document does not apply to the process control domain of nuclear facilities.

The aim of this document is to extend the contents of ISO/IECŒæ27002:2013 to the domain of process control systems and automation technology, thus allowing the energy utility industry to implement a standardized and specific information security management system (ISMS) that is in accordance with ISO/IECŒæ27001:2013 and extends from the business to the process control level.In addition to the security objectives and measures that are set forth in ISO/IECŒæ27002:2013, the process control systems used by energy utilities and energy suppliers are subject to further special requirements. In comparison with conventional ICT environments (e.g. office IT, energy trading systems), there are fundamental and significant differences with respect to the development, operation, repair, maintenance and operating environment of process control systems. Furthermore, the process technology referred to in this document can represent integral components of critical infrastructures. This means they are therefore essential for the secure and reliable operation of such infrastructures. These distinctions and characteristics need to be taken into due consideration by the management processes for process control systems and justify separate consideration within the ISO/IECŒæ27000 family of standards.From the viewpoint of design and function, process control systems used by the energy utility sector are in fact information processing systems. They collect process data and monitor the status of the physical processes using sensors. The systems then process this data and generate control outputs that regulate actions using actuators. The control and regulation is automatic but manual intervention by operating personnel is also possible. Information and information processing systems are therefore an essential part of operational processes within energy utilities. This means that it is important that appropriate protection measures be applied in the same manner as for other organizational units.Software and hardware (e.g. programmable logic) components based on standard ICT technology are increasingly utilized in process control environments and are also covered in this document. Furthermore, process control systems in the energy utility sector are increasingly interconnected to form complex systems. Risks arising from this trend need to be considered in a risk assessment.The information and information processing systems in process control environments are also exposed to an increasing number of threats and vulnerabilities. It is therefore essential that, in the process control domain of the energy utility industry, adequate information security is achieved through the implementation and continuous improvement of an ISMS in accordance with ISO/IECŒæ27001:2013.Effective information security in the process control domain of the energy utility sector can be achieved by establishing, implementing, monitoring, reviewing and, if necessary, improving the applicable measures set forth in this document, in order to attain the specific security and business objectives of the organization. It is important to give particular consideration here to the special role of the energy utilities in society and to the economic necessity of a secure and reliable energy supply. Ultimately, the overall success of the cybersecurity of energy industries is based on collaborative efforts by all stakeholders (vendors, suppliers, customers, etc.).0.2	Security considerations for process control systems used by the energy utilitiesThe requirement for a general and overall information security framework for the process control domain of the energy utility industry is based on several basic requirements:a) Customers expect a secure and reliable energy supply.b) Legal and regulatory requirements demand safe, reliable and secure operation of energy supply systems.c) Energy providers require information security in order to safeguard their business interests, meet customersäó» needs and comply with the legal regulations.0.3	Information security requirementsIt is essential that energy utility organizations identify their security requirements. There are three main sources of security requirements:a) The results of an organizationäó»s risk assessment, taking into account the organizationäó»s general business strategies and objectives. Through a risk assessment, risk sources and events are identified; potential consequences and likelihood of the occurrence of the risks are assessed.b) The requirements which result from legislation and bye-laws, regulations and contracts which have to be fulfilled by an organization, and sociocultural requirements. Particular examples include safeguarding a reliable, effective and secure energy supply as well as the reliable fulfilment of the requirements of a deregulated energy market, in particular the reliable and secure transfer of data with external parties.c) The specific principles, objectives and business requirements placed on information processing, which were developed by the organization for supporting its business operations.NOTE It is important that the energy utility organization ensure that security requirements of process control systems are analysed and adequately covered in policies for information security. The analysis of the information security requirements and objectives include the consideration of all relevant criteria for a secure energy supply and delivery, e.g.äóî Impairment of the security of energy supply;äóî Restriction of energy flow;äóî Affected share of population;äóî Danger of physical injury;äóî Effects on other critical infrastructures;äóî Effects on information privacy;äóî Financial impacts.The necessary security measures or controls are determined by the methodical assessment of security risks. It is necessary that the cost of controls be balanced against the economic losses that can be incurred due to security issues. The results of the risk assessment facilitate:äóî the definition of adequate management actions and priorities for the management of information security risks; andäóî the implementation of the controls chosen to protect against these risks.The risk assessment should be repeated periodically in order to take all changes into account, which can affect the results assessed.Requirements for the risk assessment and control selection are given in ISO/IECŒæ27001:2013.0.4	Selecting controlsOnce the security requirements and risks have been identified and decisions taken on how to deal with the risks, appropriate controls are then selected and implemented in order to ensure that the risks are reduced to an acceptable level.In addition to the controls provided by a comprehensive information security management system, this document provides additional assistance and sector-specific measures for the process control systems used by the energy utility sector, taking into consideration the special requirements in these environments. If necessary, further measures can be developed to fulfil particular requirements. The selection of security measures depends upon the decisions taken by the organization on the basis of its own risk acceptance criteria, the options for dealing with the risk and the general risk management approach of the organization. The selection of measures should also take relevant national and international law, legal ordinances and regulations into consideration.0.5	AudienceThis document is targeted at the persons responsible for the operation of process control systems used by energy utilities, information security managers, vendors, system integrators and auditors. For this target group, it details the fundamental measures in accordance with the objectives of ISO/IECŒæ27002:2013 and defines specific measures for process control systems of the energy utility industry, their supporting systems and the associated infrastructure."

By implementing this International Standard, healthcare organizations and other custodians of health information will be able to ensure a minimum requisite level of security that is appropriate to their organizationäó»s circumstances and that will maintain the confidentiality, integrity and availability of personal health information in their care.This International Standard applies to health information in all its aspects, whatever form the information takes (words and numbers, sound recordings, drawings, video, and medical images), whatever means are used to store it (printing or writing on paper or storage electronically), and whatever means are used to transmit it (by hand, through fax, over computer networks, or by post), as the information is always be appropriately protected.This International Standard and ISO/IECŒæ27002 taken together define what is required in terms of information security in healthcare, they do not define how these requirements are to be met. That is to say, to the fullest extent possible, this International Standard is technology-neutral. Neutrality with respect to implementing technologies is an important feature. Security technology is still undergoing rapid development and the pace of that change is now measured in months rather than years. By contrast, while subject to periodic review, International Standards are expected on the whole to remain valid for years. Just as importantly, technological neutrality leaves vendors and service providers free to suggest new or developing technologies that meet the necessary requirements that this International Standard describes.As noted in the introduction, familiarity with ISO/IECŒæ27002 is indispensable to an understanding of this International Standard.The following areas of information security are outside the scope of this International Standard:a) methodologies and statistical tests for effective anonymization of personal health information;b) methodologies for pseudonymization of personal health information (see Bibliography for a brief description of a Technical Specification that deals specifically with this topic);c) network quality of service and methods for measuring availability of networks used for health informatics;d) data quality (as distinct from data integrity).",,ISO 27799:2016(en),"IntroductionThis International Standard provides guidance to healthcare organizations and other custodians of personal health information on how best to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of such information. It is based upon and extends the general guidance provided by ISO/IECŒæ27002:2013 and addresses the special information security management needs of the health sector and its unique operating environments. While the protection and security of personal information is important to all individuals, corporations, institutions and governments, there are special requirements in the health  sector that need to be met to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, auditability and availability of personal health information. This type of information is regarded by many as being among the most confidential of all types of personal information. Protecting this confidentiality is essential if the privacy of subjects of care is to be maintained. The integrity of health information is to be protected to ensure patient safety, and an important component of that protection is ensuring that the informationäó»s entire life cycle be fully auditable. The availability of health information is also critical to effective healthcare delivery. Health informatics systems is to meet unique demands to remain operational in the face of natural disasters, system failures and denial-of-service attacks. Protecting the confidentiality, integrity and availability of health information therefore requires health sector specific expertise.Regardless of size, location and model of service delivery, all healthcare organizations need to have stringent controls in place to protect the health information entrusted to them. Yet many health professionals work as solo health providers or in small clinics that lack the dedicated IT resources to manage information security. Healthcare organizations therefore need clear, concise, and health-care-specific guidance on the selection and implementation of such controls. This International Standard is to be adaptable to the wide range of sizes, locations, and models of service delivery found in healthcare. Finally, with increasing electronic exchange of personal health information between health professionals (including use of wireless and Internet services), there is a clear benefit in adopting a common reference for information security management in healthcare.ISO/IECŒæ27002 is already being used extensively for health informatics IT security management through the agency of national or regional guidelines in Australia, Canada, France, the Netherlands, New Zealand, South Africa, the United Kingdom and elsewhere. ISOŒæ27799 draws upon the experience gained in these national endeavours in dealing with the security of personal health information and is intended as a companion document to ISO/IECŒæ27002. It is not intended to supplant the ISO/IECŒæ27000- series of standards. Rather, it is a complement to these more generic standards.ISOŒæ27799 applies ISO/IECŒæ27002 to the healthcare domain in a way that carefully considers the appropriate application of security controls for the purposes of protecting personal health information. These considerations have, in some cases, led the authors to conclude that application of certain ISO/IECŒæ27002 control objectives is essential if personal health information is to be adequately protected. ISOŒæ27799 therefore places constraints upon the application of certain security controls specified in ISO/IECŒæ27002.All of the security control objectives described in ISO/IECŒæ27002 are relevant to health informatics, but some controls require additional explanation in regard to how they can best be used to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of health information. There are also additional health sector specific requirements. This International Standard provides additional guidance in a format that persons responsible for health information security can readily understand and adopt.In the health domain, it is possible for an organization (a hospital, say) to be certified using ISO/IECŒæ27001 without requiring certification against or even acknowledgement of ISOŒæ27799. It is to be hoped, however, that as healthcare organizations strive to improve the security of personal health information, conformance with ISOŒæ27799 as a stricter standard for healthcare will also become widespread.ObjectivesMaintaining information confidentiality, availability, and integrity (including authenticity, accountability and auditability) are the overarching goals of information security. In healthcare, privacy of subjects of care depends upon maintaining the confidentiality of personal health information. To maintain confidentiality, measures is also be taken to maintain the integrity of data, if for no other reason than that it is possible to corrupt the integrity of access control data, audit trails, and other system data in ways that allow breaches in confidentiality to take place or to go unnoticed. In addition, patient safety depends upon maintaining the integrity of personal health information, failure to do this can also result in illness, injury or even death. Likewise, a high level of availability is an especially important attribute of health systems, where treatment is often time-critical. Indeed, disasters that could lead to outages in other, non-health related, IT systems may be the very times when the information contained in health systems is most critically needed. Moreover, denial of service attacks against networked systems are increasingly common.The controls discussed in this International Standard are those identified as appropriate in healthcare to protect confidentiality, integrity and availability of personal health information and to ensure that access to such information can be audited and accounted for. These controls help to prevent errors in medical practice that might ensue from failure to maintain the integrity of health information. In addition, they help to ensure that the continuity of medical services is maintained.There are additional considerations that shape the goals of health information security. These includes the following:a) honouring legislative obligations as expressed in applicable data protection laws and regulations protecting a subject of care is right to privacy;1b) maintaining established privacy and security best practices in health informatics;c) maintaining individual and organizational accountability among health organizations and health professionals;d) supporting the implementation of systematic risk management within health organizations;e) meeting the security needs identified in common healthcare situations;f) reducing operating costs by facilitating the increased use of technology in a safe, secure, and well managed manner that supports, but does not constrain current health activities;g) maintaining public trust in health organizations and the information systems these organizations rely upon;h) maintaining professional standards and ethics as established by health-related professional organizations (insofar as information security maintains the confidentiality and integrity of health information);i) operating electronic health information systems in an environment appropriately secured against threats;j) facilitating interoperability among health systems, since health information increasingly flows among organizations and across jurisdictional boundaries (especially as such interoperability enhances the proper handling of health information to ensure its continued confidentiality, integrity and availability).Relation to information governance,2 corporate governance and clinical governanceWhile health organizations may differ in their positions on clinical governance and corporate governance, the importance of integrating and attending to information governance ought to be beyond debate as a vital support to both. As health organizations have become ever more critically dependent on information systems to support care delivery (e.g. by exploiting decision support technologies and trends towards äóìevidence basedäóù rather than äóìexperience basedäóù healthcare), it has become evident that events in which losses of integrity, availability and confidentiality occur may have a significant clinical impact and that problems arising from such impacts will be seen to represent failures in the ethical and legal obligations inherent in a äóìduty of careäóù.All countries and jurisdictions will undoubtedly have case studies where such breaches have led to misdiagnoses, deaths, or protracted recoveries. Clinical governance frameworks need therefore to treat effective information security risk management as equal in importance to care treatment plans, infection management strategies and other äóìcoreäóù clinical management matters. This International Standard will assist those responsible for clinical governance in understanding the contribution made by effective information security strategies.Health information to be protectedThere are several types of information whose confidentiality, integrity and availability3 needs to be protected bya) personal health information,b) pseudonymized data derived from personal health information through some methodology for pseudonymous identification,c) statistical and research data, including anonymized data derived from personal health information by removal of personally identifying data,d) clinical/medical knowledge not related to any specific subjects of care, including clinical decision support data (e.g. data on adverse drug reactions),e) data on health professionals, staff and volunteers,f) information related to public health surveillance,g) audit trail data, produced by health information systems, that contain personal health information or pseudonymous data derived from personal health information, or that contain data about the actions of users in regard to personal health information, andh) system security data for health information systems, including access control data and other security related system configuration data, for health information systems.The extent to which confidentiality, integrity and availability need to be protected depends upon the nature of the information, the uses to which it is put, and the risks to which it is exposed. For example, statistical data [item c) above] may not be confidential, but protecting its integrity may be very important. Likewise, audit trail data [item g) above] might not require high availability (frequent archiving with a retrieval time measured in hours rather than seconds might suffice in a given application) but its content might be highly confidential. Risk assessment can properly determine the level of effort needed to protect confidentiality, integrity and availability (see B.4.4). The results of regular risk assessment need to be fitted to the priorities and resources of the implementing organization.Threats and vulnerabilities in health information securityTypes of information security threats and vulnerabilities vary widely, as do their descriptions. While none are truly unique to healthcare, what is unique in healthcare is the array of factors to be considered when assessing threats and vulnerabilities.By their nature, health organizations operate in an environment where visitors and the public at large can never be totally excluded. In large health organizations, the sheer volume of people moving through operational areas is significant. These factors increase the vulnerability of systems to physical threats. The likelihood that such threats will occur may increase when emotional or mentally ill subjects of care or relatives are present.The critical importance of correctly identifying subjects of care and correctly matching them to their health records leads health organizations to collect detailed identifying information. Regional or jurisdictional patient registries (i.e. registries of subjects of care) are sometimes the most comprehensive and up-to-date repositories of identifying information available in a jurisdiction. This identifying information is of great potential value to those who would use it to commit identity theft and so should be rigorously protected.Many health organizations are chronically under-funded and their staff members are sometimes obliged to work under significant stress and with systems kept in service long after they ought to have been retired. These factors can increase the potential for certain types of threat and can exacerbate vulnerabilities. On the other hand, clinical care involves a range of professional, technical, administrative, ancillary and voluntary staff, many of whom see their work as a vocation. Their dedication and diversity of experience can often usefully reduce exposure to vulnerabilities. The high level of professional training received by many health professionals also sets healthcare apart from many other industrial sectors in reducing the incidence of insider threats.The health environment, with its unique threats and vulnerabilities should therefore be considered with special care. Annex A contains an informative list of the types of threat that need to be considered by health organizations when they assess risks to the confidentiality, integrity and availability of health information and to the integrity and availability of related information systems.Who should read this International Standard?This International Standard is intended for those responsible for overseeing health information security and for healthcare organizations and other custodians of health information seeking guidance on this topic, together with their security advisors, consultants, auditors, vendors and third-party service providers.This International Standards authors do not intend to write a primer on computer security, nor to restate what has already been written in ISO/IECŒæ27002 or in ISO/IECŒæ27001. There are many security requirements that are common to all computer-related systems, whether used in financial services, manufacturing, industrial control, or indeed in any other organized endeavour. A concerted effort has been made to focus on security requirements necessitated by the unique challenges of delivering electronic health information that supports the provision of care.Benefits of using this International StandardISO/IECŒæ27002 is a broad and complex International Standard and its advice is not tailored specifically to healthcare. ISOŒæ27799 allows for the implementation of ISO/IECŒæ27002 within health environments in a consistent fashion and with particular attention to the unique challenges that the health sector poses. By following it, healthcare organizations help to ensure that the confidentiality and integrity of data in their care is maintained, that critical health information systems remain available and that accountability for health information is upheld.The adoption of this International Standard by healthcare organizations both within and among jurisdictions will assist interoperation and enable the safe adoption of new collaborative technologies in the delivery of healthcare. Secure and privacy-protective information sharing can significantly improve healthcare outcomes.As a result of implementing this International Standard, healthcare organizations can expect to see the number and severity of their security incidents reduced, allowing resources to be redeployed to productive activities. IT security will thereby allow health resources to be deployed in a cost effective and productive manner. Indeed, research by the respected Information Security Forum and by market analysts has shown that good all-round security can have as much as a 2Œæ% positive effect upon organizationsäó» results.Finally, a consistent approach to IT security, understandable by all involved in healthcare, will improve staff morale and increase the trust of the public in the systems that maintain personal health information.How to use this International StandardReaders not already familiar with ISO/IECŒæ27002 are urged to read the introductory clauses of that standard before continuing. The implementers of ISOŒæ27799 is to read first thoroughly ISO/IECŒæ27002, as the text below will frequently refer the reader to the relevant clauses of that standard. The present International Standard cannot be fully understood without access to the full text of ISO/IECŒæ27002.Readers seeking guidance on how to implement ISO/IECŒæ27002 in a health environment will find a practical action plan described in AnnexŒæB. No mandatory requirements are contained in this clause. Instead, general advice and guidance are given on how best to proceed with implementation of ISO/IECŒæ27002 in healthcare. The clause is organized around a cycle of activities (plan/do/check/act) that are described in ISO/IECŒæ27001 and that, when followed, will lead to a robust implementation of an information security management system.Readers seeking specific advice on the security control security control categories and clauses described in ISO/IECŒæ27002 will find it in the clauses of this International Standard with the same clause number and title as is found in ISO/IECŒæ27002. This clause leads the reader through each of the eleven security control clauses of the ISO/IECŒæ27002. Minimum requirements are stated where appropriate and, in some cases, normative guidelines are set out on the proper application of certain ISO/IECŒæ27002 security controls to the protection of health information.Once ISO/IECŒæ27002 has been put into place, the ongoing management is considered essential if the benefits of the International Standard are to be maintained. ClauseŒæ18 discusses compliance assessment and the requirements for ongoing information security management. AnnexŒæC contains a self-assessment matrix with regard to compliance.This International Standard concludes with four informative appendices.AnnexŒæA describes the general threats to health information. AnnexŒæB briefly describes a practical action plan for implementing complementary information security related International Standards. AnnexŒæC provides a checklist for compliance to ISOŒæ27799. Clause 2 lists the standards that are cited in a normative way; the Bibliography lists other related standards in health information security."

Therefore, this International Standard is not specific to any industry or sector.NOTE For convenience, all the different users of this International Standard are referred to by the general term äóìorganizationäóù.This International Standard can be applied throughout the life of an organization, and to a wide range of activities, including strategies and decisions, operations, processes, functions, projects, products, services and assets.This International Standard can be applied to any type of risk, whatever its nature, whether having positive or negative consequences.Although this International Standard provides generic guidelines, it is not intended to promote uniformity of risk management across organizations. The design and implementation of risk management plans and frameworks will need to take into account the varying needs of a specific organization, its particular objectives, context, structure, operations, processes, functions, projects, products, services, or assets and specific practices employed.It is intended that this International Standard be utilized to harmonize risk management processes in existing and future standards. It provides a common approach in support of standards dealing with specific risks and/or sectors, and does not replace those standards.This International Standard is not intended for the purpose of certification.",,ISO 31000:2009(en),"IntroductionOrganizations of all types and sizes face internal and external factors and influences that make it uncertain whether and when they will achieve their objectives. The effect this uncertainty has on an organization's objectives is äóìriskäóù.All activities of an organization involve risk. Organizations manage risk by identifying it, analysing it and then evaluating whether the risk should be modified by risk treatment in order to satisfy their risk criteria. Throughout this process, they communicate and consult with stakeholders and monitor and review the risk and the controls that are modifying the risk in order to ensure that no further risk treatment is required. This International Standard describes this systematic and logical process in detail.While all organizations manage risk to some degree, this International Standard establishes a number of principles that need to be satisfied to make risk management effective. This International Standard recommends that organizations develop, implement and continuously improve a framework whose purpose is to integrate the process for managing risk into the organization's overall governance, strategy and planning, management, reporting processes, policies, values and culture.Risk management can be applied to an entire organization, at its many areas and levels, at any time, as well as to specific functions, projects and activities.Although the practice of risk management has been developed over time and within many sectors in order to meet diverse needs, the adoption of consistent processes within a comprehensive framework can help to ensure that risk is managed effectively, efficiently and coherently across an organization. The generic approach described in this International Standard provides the principles and guidelines for managing any form of risk in a systematic, transparent and credible manner and within any scope and context.Each specific sector or application of risk management brings with it individual needs, audiences, perceptions and criteria. Therefore, a key feature of this International Standard is the inclusion of äóìestablishing the contextäóù as an activity at the start of this generic risk management process. Establishing the context will capture the objectives of the organization, the environment in which it pursues those objectives, its stakeholders and the diversity of risk criteria äóñ all of which will help reveal and assess the nature and complexity of its risks.The relationship between the principles for managing risk, the framework in which it occurs and the risk management process described in this International Standard are shown in FigureŒæ1.When implemented and maintained in accordance with this International Standard, the management of risk enables an organization to, for example:äóî increase the likelihood of achieving objectives;äóî encourage proactive management;äóî be aware of the need to identify and treat risk throughout the organization;äóî improve the identification of opportunities and threats;äóî comply with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and international norms;äóî improve mandatory and voluntary reporting;äóî improve governance;äóî improve stakeholder confidence and trust;äóî establish a reliable basis for decision making and planning;äóî improve controls;äóî effectively allocate and use resources for risk treatment;äóî improve operational effectiveness and efficiency;äóî enhance health and safety performance, as well as environmental protection;äóî improve loss prevention and incident management;äóî minimize losses;äóî improve organizational learning; andäóî improve organizational resilience.This International Standard is intended to meet the needs of a wide range of stakeholders, including:a) those responsible for developing risk management policy within their organization;b) those accountable for ensuring that risk is effectively managed within the organization as a whole or within a specific area, project or activity;c) those who need to evaluate an organization's effectiveness in managing risk; andd) developers of standards, guides, procedures and codes of practice that, in whole or in part, set out how risk is to be managed within the specific context of these documents.The current management practices and processes of many organizations include components of risk management, and many organizations have already adopted a formal risk management process for particular types of risk or circumstances. In such cases, an organization can decide to carry out a critical review of its existing practices and processes in the light of this International Standard.In this International Standard, the expressions äóìrisk managementäóù and äóìmanaging riskäóù are both used. In general terms, äóìrisk managementäóù refers to the architecture (principles, framework and process) for managing risks effectively, while äóìmanaging riskäóù refers to applying that architecture to particular risks.FigureŒæ1äóîRelationships between the risk management principles, framework and process"

It specifies requirements for the service provider to plan, establish, implement, operate, monitor, review, maintain and improve an SMS. The requirements include the design, transition, delivery and improvement of services to fulfil service requirements. This part of ISO/IECŒæ20000 can be used by:a) an organization seeking services from service providers and requiring assurance that their service requirements will be fulfilled;b) an organization that requires a consistent approach by all its service providers, including those in a supply chain;c) a service provider that intends to demonstrate its capability for the design, transition, delivery and improvement of services that fulfil service requirements;d) a service provider to monitor, measure and review its service management processes and services;e) a service provider to improve the design, transition and delivery of services through effective implementation and operation of an SMS;f) an assessor or auditor as the criteria for a conformity assessment of a service provider's SMS to the requirements in this part of ISO/IECŒæ20000.FigureŒæ2 illustrates an SMS, including the service management processes. The service management processes and the relationships between the processes can be implemented in different ways by different service providers. The nature of the relationship between a service provider and the customer will influence how the service management processes are implemented.FigureŒæ2äóîService management system1.2ŒæŒæŒæApplicationAll requirements in this part of ISO/IECŒæ20000 are generic and are intended to be applicable to all service providers, regardless of type, size and the nature of the services delivered. Exclusion of any of the requirements in ClausesŒæ4 to 9 is not acceptable when a service provider claims conformity to this part of ISO/IECŒæ20000, irrespective of the nature of the service provider's organization.Conformity to the requirements in ClauseŒæ4 can only be demonstrated by a service provider showing evidence of fulfilling all of the requirements in ClauseŒæ4. A service provider cannot rely on evidence of the governance of processes operated by other parties for the requirements in ClauseŒæ4.Conformity to the requirements in ClausesŒæ5 to 9 can be demonstrated by the service provider showing evidence of fulfilling all requirements. Alternatively, the service provider can show evidence of fulfilling the majority of the requirements themselves and evidence of the governance of processes operated by other parties for those processes, or parts of processes, that the service provider does not operate directly.The scope of this part of ISO/IECŒæ20000 excludes the specification for a product or tool. However, organizations can use this part of ISO/IECŒæ20000 to help them develop products or tools that support the operation of an SMS.NOTE ISO/IEC TRŒæ20000-3 provides guidance on scope definition and applicability of this part of ISO/IECŒæ20000. This includes further explanation about the governance of processes operated by other parties.",,ISO/IEC 20000-1:2011(en),"IntroductionThe requirements in this part of ISO/IECŒæ20000 include the design, transition, delivery and improvement of services that fulfil service requirements and provide value for both the customer and the service provider. This part of ISO/IECŒæ20000 requires an integrated process approach when the service provider plans, establishes, implements, operates, monitors, reviews, maintains and improves a service management system (SMS).Co-ordinated integration and implementation of an SMS provides ongoing control and opportunities for continual improvement, greater effectiveness and efficiency. The operation of processes as specified in this part of ISO/IECŒæ20000 requires personnel to be well organized and co-ordinated. Appropriate tools can be used to enable the processes to be effective and efficient.The most effective service providers consider the impact on the SMS through all stages of the service lifecycle, from strategy through design, transition and operation, including continual improvement.This part of ISO/IECŒæ20000 requires the application of the methodology known as äóìPlan-Do-Check-Actäóù (PDCA) to all parts of the SMS and the services. The PDCA methodology, as applied in this part of ISO/IECŒæ20000, can be briefly described as follows.Plan: establishing, documenting and agreeing the SMS. The SMS includes the policies, objectives, plans and processes to fulfil the service requirements.Do: implementing and operating the SMS for the design, transition, delivery and improvement of the services.Check: monitoring, measuring and reviewing the SMS and the services against the policies, objectives, plans and service requirements and reporting the results.Act: taking actions to continually improve performance of the SMS and the services.When used within an SMS, the following are the most important aspects of an integrated process approach and the PDCA methodology:a) understanding and fulfilling the service requirements to achieve customer satisfaction;b) establishing the policy and objectives for service management;c) designing and delivering services based on the SMS that add value for the customer;d) monitoring, measuring and reviewing performance of the SMS and the services;e) continually improving the SMS and the services based on objective measurements.FigureŒæ1 illustrates how the PDCA methodology can be applied to the SMS, including the service management processes specified in ClausesŒæ5 to 9, and the services. Each element of the PDCA methodology is a vital part of a successful implementation of an SMS. The improvement process used in this part of ISO/IECŒæ20000 is based on the PDCA methodology.FigureŒæ1äóîPDCA methodology applied to service managementThis part of ISO/IECŒæ20000 enables a service provider to integrate its SMS with other management systems in the service provider's organization. The adoption of an integrated process approach and the PDCA methodology enables the service provider to align or fully integrate multiple management system standards. For example, an SMS can be integrated with a quality management system based on ISOŒæ9001 or an information security management system based on ISO/IECŒæ27001.ISO/IECŒæ20000 is intentionally independent of specific guidance. The service provider can use a combination of generally accepted guidance and its own experience.Users of an International Standard are responsible for its correct application. An International Standard does not purport to include all necessary statutory and regulatory requirements and contractual obligations of the service provider. Conformity to an International Standard does not of itself confer immunity from statutory and regulatory requirements.For the purposes of research on service management standards, users are encouraged to share their views on ISO/IECŒæ20000-1 and their priorities for changes to the rest of the ISO/IECŒæ20000 series.

This document intends to promote worldwide trade of small spacecraft products by providing a minimum level of assurance that a product made of non-space-qualified commercial-off-the-shelf parts and units can work in space. This document also aims to serve as a testing guideline for those who intend to enter satellite manufacturing through development of small spacecraft products."

For EEDI, the environmental conditions are: no wind, no waves, no current and deep water of 15ŒÁC.Normally, such stipulated conditions are unlikely to be experienced in part or in full during the actual trials.

In practice, certain corrections for the environmental conditions have to be considered, such as for water depth, wind, waves and current [1][2].The purpose of this International Standard is to define the basic requirements for the performance of speed trials, and provide procedures for evaluation and correction of speed trial data, covering all influences which may be relevant to the individual trial runs based on sound scientific grounds, thereby enabling owners and others to have confidence in the validity of the final results.This International Standard is intended to help the interested parties achieve the desired target accuracy of, within 2Œæ% in shaft power and 0,1Œækn in speed.The procedure specified in this International Standard has been developed largely on the basis of published data on speed trials and on shipäó»s performance, the more important among them being listed in ClauseŒæ2.ISO has invited the International Towing Tank Conference (ITTC) to co-operate on the development of a new standard for speed/power trials taking into account the new guidelines issued by ITTC and approved by MEPC65 for EEDI.

MSML is a language for structuring information and the goal is to create an open standard that can be used generally in the maritime sector. This Publicly Available Specification emphasizes the following aspects of MSML:äó¢ functional applicability in the maritime arena with focus on repair and maintenance and related safety aspects;äó¢ secure transfer of information between vessel and shore base;äó¢ extensibility to incorporate increased functionality;äó¢ use of standardized XML support whenever needed.The basis of MSML is the data model which defines what kind of maritime data, related to vessel and shore base, it is possible to store. The data model represents the current state and only limited historic information is kept in the data model. This Publicly Available Specification defines the following information areas of the data model:äó¢ the vessel,äó¢ the actual use and status of the vessel,äó¢ the shore base,äó¢ the actual use and status of one berth of the shore base,äó¢ the relation between the vessel and the shore base,äó¢ the history of repair and maintenance and what has been done on each occasion.The data model of MSML makes it possible to describe the following states:äó¢ a vessel with/without defined task,äó¢ a berth of a shore base with/without defined task,äó¢ a vessel and a berth of a shore base with/without relation.Defining states makes it possible to define transactions, i.e. sequences of actions for fulfilling specific intentions. We have the general transactions:äó¢ assigning task to/removing task from vessel,äó¢ assigning task to/removing task from a berth of a shore base (for a specific vessel),äó¢ assigning relation/removing relation vessel äóî a berth of a shore base,äó¢ assigning/removing specific pieces of data,äó¢ reading data.This Publicly Available Specification defines perspectives associated with the data model of MSML. The term indicates that the MSML data model can be seen from different views. Perspectives contain information that is orthogonal to the data model. Two perspectives are defined:äó¢ inspection äóî an inherent perspective that makes it possible to reference results of vessel inspections;äó¢ repair and maintenance äóî currently the main focus of MSML.There are also other sources of information that are associated with MSML. The data model of MSML assumes that information concerning individual crew and passenger members is handled adequately using the muster list and passenger list, respectively. However, for the data model of MSML groups of individuals are considered. The primary purpose of MSML is to make it possible to identify available capabilities and resources and not to handle individuals. However, a reference is included in MSML where to find detailed information.A certain amount of shore base information is included in the data model of MSML. The main reason to include this information is to support vessel safety related aspects and vessel repair and maintenance.1.2ŒæŒæŒæLimitationsAn MSML instance will contain extensive history information only if included in the definition of a perspective. For example, repair and maintenance contains an extensive history of what has been changed and when, but there is no extensive history information for e.g. bunkering. The reason for including history is that actions made in the past can affect future events and decisions. However, some minor historic information is included in the data model of MSML (i.e. not within perspectives), e.g. the history of vessel name changes. If other types of extensive history information are needed, a new version of the MSML instance has to be stored for each significant change and this must be handled outside the scope of MSML (probably using a native XML database).The data model of MSML should not primarily be seen as a support for normal work onboard. Instead it is an add-on support for transfers of safety related information to/from the vessel from/to external units and within the vessel. For example, current propeller revolutions per minute cannot be extracted from the computerized MSML system, instead the value is read directly from the ordinary equipment. In the same way the shore base part of the MSML data model is seen as a support to the safety related vessel information and not from normal work ashore. Generally, normal dynamic information during a voyage between two shore bases is not included within MSML. On the other hand, alarms and malfunctioning units are generally safety related and of interest internally and externally and thus included in the data model of MSML. If alarms are set automatically or not is a question outside the scope of MSML.1.3ŒæŒæŒæExclusionsThe following aspects are not included in the scope of MSML:äó¢ aspects concerning costs and fees;äó¢ geographic information;äó¢ logs, e.g. log of communication;äó¢ specific cargo information, e.g. tracing, Smart and Secure Tradelanes;äó¢ presentation of information;äó¢ users and their authorities;äó¢ actual use of data and instances, e.g. definition of messages;äó¢ bindings to protocols.1.4ŒæŒæŒæSummaryTo sum up the main characteristics of MSML, itäó¢ contains an XML-based data model for information exchange and processing in safety-critical maritime applications;äó¢ does not describe how data is used;äó¢ supports information security and extensibility;äó¢ is a framework and future open standard for the maritime safety sector.The principal system dependences on MSML are shown in FigureŒæ2.FigureŒæ2äóîPrincipal system dependences on MSMLWe see that MSML will affect system design and definition of messages but MSML is not affected. Thus MSML can remain a stable standard for a wide variety of applications.",,ISO/PAS 22853:2005(en),

Uncontrolled and incomplete combustion processes are responsible for the emission of chemical and physical pollutants in quantities that affect humans and the environment. This problem is severe, not only in industrialized regions, but also in less developed, predominantly agricultural areas where people depend on biomass as fuel for cooking, heating and lighting.General awareness of the fact that fires can present acute and persistent adverse effects on the environment has been accentuated by a number of high impact incidents over the past half century.

It is therefore important to distinguish between the natural concentrations and fluxes of these substances and the extent to which they are augmented by human activities. Such distinctions are essential if informed decisions are to be made regarding the management of contaminantsäóù[3].This document is principally intended for use by the following parties: environmental regulatory authorities, fire fighters and investigators, storage facility operators, materials and product manufacturers, property owners, and public health authorities."

A synthetic image is a generated depiction of spatial data in a visual form. Both natural and synthetic image data are being used increasingly in the area of geographic information/geomatics. Gridded data is the representation of attribute values in terms of a spatial grid. All three of these forms of spatial information can be handled in a similar manner by representation in terms of a raster or matrix structure. Both a raster and a matrix are array structures that may be coded somewhat differently due to the characteristics of the data.An increasingly large volume of natural and synthetic image and gridded data is being produced. For example, current imaging satellites include LandSAT, RADARSAT, SPOT, ERS, MOS, JERS and NOAA. Also, there are military satellite images and other public and private domain image sources. There are current plans to launch more than one hundred Earth observing satellites by the year 2005, with 60 of those scheduled for launch by the end of 1999, with some of these satellites generating as many as 22Œæ000 scenes per day. Digital orthophoto mapping is another field in which major financial investment is being made and in which a large volume of raster data is being produced. Obviously, there will be great demand for this imagery to be in a standard format in order to be useful with other sources of data.Large volumes of synthetic imagery are being produced by the scanning of the current large inventory of paper maps and charts, and it is expected that the volume of this data will exceed the production of vector based data sets for a long time. Synthetic raster maps include scanned paper map products, such as topographic maps, nautical charts, soil and vegetation maps and other such products. They also include raster data sets generated directly from vector data sets. Since the demand for image and gridded data is large and will be rapidly increasing in the near future, it is necessary to address this form of data in ISO/TCŒæ211. Many countries and international organizations are producing Digital Elevation Models (DEMs). Many other forms of gridded data such as georeferenced socio-economic data including land use data, meteorological and bathymetric data are being compiled in large volumes.Earth observation networks and information infrastructures are being developed in many countries to further improve the access and use of remote sensing data, products and services, with the objective to provide state-of-the-art interfaces between the data archives and their users. The interoperability between data archivesŒæäóî an important element of which is interoperable standardsŒæäóî will greatly facilitate a more effective operation by government bodies and the value-added sector.The specific aim of this work item is to analyse the characteristics of imagery and gridded data and make recommendations with respect to how this data can be handled in ISO/TCŒæ211. There is a significant overlap between many of the current ISO/TCŒæ211 work items and those areas that require standardization to support imagery and gridded data. For example, it is possible to share many metadata elements between vector and raster representations, but some unique metadata will be required to handle particular raster related aspects.The main interests that will benefit from the standardization of raster and matrix data formats will be the distributors and end-users of raster data. Currently, each satellite effectively defines its own ""standard"" based on the characteristics of its sensors. There also exists a large number of ""standard"" formats for the exchange and distribution of synthetic raster data such as scanned paper maps. Integration of data is difficult at best.Although there are some aspects of sensor characteristics that are unique to particular data sources, there is a high degree of commonality underlying the basic parameters. In addition, many of the aspects of the existing ISO/TCŒæ211 work on vector standards, such as geographic referencing, quality, metadata, positioning services, and portrayal are applicable to raster and matrix data."

The production of imagery and gridded data follows one or more process chains that begin with remote sensing data, scanned maps, field data collection or other sensing methods and end with the creation of the end data products. The production process needs to be documented in order to maintain quality control over the end products. In addition, metadata about the geometry of the measuring process and the properties of the measuring equipment need to be retained with the raw data in order to support the production process.Within the suite of ISO geographic information standards, ISOŒæ19115 defines the guidelines for describing geographic information and services. While the ISOŒæ19115 metadata model does provide some provisions for imagery and gridded data, the requirements were not fully developed at the time ISOŒæ19115:2003 was drafted. To permit the development of ISOŒæ19115 to proceed, inclusion of metadata definitions for imagery and gridded data was deferred until the framework for these data was more fully specified within the suite of ISO geographic information standards. Additionally, other standards that implement metadata for imagery and gridded data have been surveyed and are described in ISO/TRŒæ19121.The object of this part of ISOŒæ19115 is to provide the additional structure to more extensively describe the derivation of geographic imagery and gridded data. This structure is intended to augment ISOŒæ19115."

This framework defines a content model for the content type imagery and for other specific content types that can be represented as coverage data. These content models are represented as a set of generic UML patterns for application schemas.",,ISO/TS 19129:2009(en),"IntroductionGridded data, including imagery, is a major form of geographic information. Over the past two decades many, largely incompatible, standards have been developed that are widely used for the interchange of geographic imagery and gridded data. These include standards developed by ISO, as well as those developed by other organizations. With so many different imagery and gridded data standards, each standard aimed at different but overlapping information communities, there is a considerable legacy problem. Working with data encoded using different formats is often difficult because all of the necessary information for interworking has not been recorded using some of these standards. It is not possible to develop a new comprehensive standard to replace what exists or to simply endorse one existing standard (or industrial specification) to äóìsolveäóù the interworking problem, because very large volumes of data exist in the various formats already in use. The Technical Report ISO/TRŒæ19121:2000 identified the existing work on imagery and gridded data that had been ongoing in ISO and external technical organizations. What is required is a structure that allows for the specification of the content in a manner independent of and compatible with the various different encoding standards.The area of imagery, gridded and coverage data is one of the most challenging within the field of geographic information. The data appears to be simple; however, there is significant structural complexity. While most data is organized in simple grids, there are many different traversal methods for grids and structures that support the distribution of attributes over a space. Sensor information and associated georeferencing are an important aspect of imagery, gridded and coverage geographic information.This Technical Specification endeavours to address the harmonization of the broad legacy of existing imagery and gridded data. The approach specified is not to build a very flexible standard that encompasses everything with a broad array of options, since that does not create compatibility. One can be fooled into thinking things are standardized, because two data sets use incompatible subsets of the same set of general standards. All that would be accomplished would be to give an ISO label to the existing diversity and incompatibility. Compatibility is required for the underlying structure and primary elements of information content, regardless of how that information content is expressed. The purpose of this Technical Specification is to provide a framework within which interworking can occur. The approach used is to define a set of a few common information content structures for geographic imagery, gridded data and certain types of coverage data, which can be expressed using different encoding mechanisms and different interchange standards. The compatibility results from the common underlying content models that are expressed as a generic set of UML patterns for application schemas.This Technical Specification recognizes that there are many overlapping imagery and gridded data specifications in wide use that differ significantly in how the information content is structured for encoding and in what choices of information form the content model. Different types of encoding may be appropriate in different situations. However, differences in content are difficult to reconcile. The existing different encoding standards do not necessarily conflict because they represent different ways of providing the same information in different contexts. Differences in content are also permitted for different situations, but the content definition must be the same in similar situations for interchange to be achieved without loss of information.Most of the existing specifications for imagery and gridded data used in industry specify how content is to be expressed, rather than the content itself. They relate content to encoding, encapsulation and transfer of data. Those content descriptions that do appear to vary from one specification to another may not be in conflict or incompatible but reflect different real world situations that require different treatments.This Technical Specification combines a number of well-defined content structures in accordance with ISOŒæ19123, the International Standard for coverage geometry and functions together with metadata, spatial referencing and other aspects of imagery, gridded and coverage data into a framework. This will foster a convergence at the content model level for existing imagery, gridded and coverage data while allowing for backward compatibility with the identified suite of existing standards."

In this context, real-time streaming includes all modes where video is sent from a spacecraft in a continuous stream and is intended for immediate use when received, regardless of the latency of the transmission path. Other specialized motion imagery applications, such as high-speed scientific motion imagery and multi-spectral motion imagery, are not addressed in this document. However, if a specialized imagery camera system has a requirement to interface to spacecraft systems in a video mode, it would be required to match these interfaces.Ground-systems-to-ground-systems video distribution is obviously a key component of the entire video system. However, this is not the primary focus of this document. Currently, there are significant differences in the ways mission video products are exchanged between the various space agencies on the ground. This is the result of differences in network topologies between space agencies, and agreements for video sharing. Those differences preclude there being a standard methodology for delivering video imagery between agencies. Prior to the commencement of video transmission between space agencies, system design reviews and performance testing should be done between the ground systems in use to assure operability when video imagery comes from spacecraft.1.2ŒæŒæŒæAPPLICABILITYThis document is a CCSDS Recommended Standard. It is intended for all missions that produce, consume, or transcode video imagery from low-bandwidth video such as web streaming through high-bandwidth video such as high-definition television imagery.1.3ŒæŒæŒæNOMENCLATURE1.3.1ŒæŒæŒæNORMATIVE TEXTThe following conventions apply for the normative specifications in this Recommended Standard:a) the words äóÖshalläó» and äóÖmustäó» imply a binding and verifiable specification;b) the word äóÖshouldäó» implies an optional, but desirable, specification;c) the word äóÖmayäó» implies an optional specification;d) the words äóÖisäó», äóÖareäó», and äóÖwilläó» imply statements of fact.NOTE äóî These conventions do not imply constraints on diction in text that is clearly informative in nature.1.3.2ŒæŒæŒæINFORMATIVE TEXTIn the normative sections of this document, informative text is set off from the normative specifications either in notes or under one of the following subsection headings:äóî Overview;äóî Background;äóî Rationale;äóî Discussion.1.4ŒæŒæŒæREFERENCESThe following publications contain provisions which, through reference in this text, constitute provisions of this document.

ISO/TSŒæ19101-2, ISOŒæ19123 and ISO/TSŒæ19129 specify domains and ranges of imagery, grids and coverages, and their associated relationships. ISO/TSŒæ19129 breaks down the metadata into discovery, structural, acquisition and quality metadata. However, there are no detailed descriptions on each category and no clear associations with metadata defined in ISOŒæ19115:2003, ISOŒæ19115-2, ISO/TSŒæ19130 and ISO/TSŒæ19130-2.Imagery is acquired by remote sensors directly or derived from source imagery. Value-added image processing can be used to derive physical properties of a remote object from images (ISO/TSŒæ19101-2). Besides the derived images, imagery can also be integrated with other data sources to produce new gridded coverage data for a specific theme, called thematic data, which is widely used in various applications. However, the characteristics of thematic data are not covered by the existing International Standards and Technical Specifications noted above.ISO/TSŒæ19130 identifies the type of remote sensors by the measurand of the sensor, e.g. optical radiation, microwave energy and SONAR (acoustic) energy. Images acquired by optical sensors have different appearances and characteristics compared with those by a microwave sensor, e.g. SAR data.The framework defined in ISO/TSŒæ19129 describes imagery, gridded and coverage data at multiple levels, including an abstract level, a content model level and an encoding level. The first two levels combine a number of well-defined content structures in accordance with ISOŒæ19123 and define the contents of continuous quadrilateral gridded coverages with grids of both constant and variable cell sizes. However, the content model level does not specify the necessary metadata for common understanding when integrating datasets encoded in different formats. At the encoding level, ISO/TSŒæ19129 does not provide the explicit encoding rules for mapping content model to machine-independent encoding structure, which is crucial for the mapping and translation of images in different formats without losing information.Based on the frameworks defined in ISO/TSŒæ19101-2 and ISOŒæ19123, this Technical Specification specifies the categories of imagery and gridded data and establishes a corresponding hierarchical content model. Categories of imagery and gridded data are defined based on thematic and spatial attributes and sensor types. The content model is then defined to describe the required content components of each category, including the spatial and attribute structures and the critical metadata entries as well. These metadata entries are specified as the minimum required metadata information for the purpose of common understanding. Traditionally, remote sensing data products generally have a header part and a data part. This Technical Specification describes the minimum content requirements for the header part.For ease of implementation, this Technical Specification defines encoding rules to map the content models to XML-based encodings, following the general encoding rules defined in ISOŒæ19118 and the encoding rules for UML-to-GML application schema defined in ISOŒæ19136:2007, AnnexŒæE. Since GMLCOV schema (OGCŒæ09-146r2) is optimized for handling coverages, the coverage component of the schema can be based on GMLCOV.An increasingly large volume of image and gridded data, both natural and synthetic, is being produced because more remote sensors are becoming available. These data are encoded in diverse formats, such as GeoTIFF, BIIF, HDF-EOS, JPEG 2000, NetCDF and others as described in ISO/TRŒæ19121. These encoding formats follow different data models, preventing them from being interoperable. In order to encode the contents defined in this Technical Specification into these data formats, ISOŒæ19163 has been split into multiple parts with this Technical Specification defining the content components and general encoding rules and the subsequent parts defining the binding between the contents and individual physical data formats."

Typical spatial outcomes of the production process are vector maps, Digital Elevation Models, and three-dimensional city models. There are typically two streams of spectral data analysis, that is, the statistical method, which includes image segmentation, and the physics-based method, which relies on characterization of specific spectral absorption features.In each of the cases, the quality of the end products fully depends on the quality of the measuring instruments that has originally sensed the data. The quality of measuring instruments is determined and documented by calibration.A calibration is often a costly and time-consuming process. Therefore, a number of different strategies are used that combine longer time intervals between subsequent calibrations with simplified intermediate calibration procedures that bridge the time gap and still guarantee a traceable level of quality. Those intermediate calibrations are called validations in this part of ISOŒæ19159.This part of ISOŒæ19159 standardizes the calibration of remote sensing imagery sensors and the validation of the calibration information and procedures. It does not address the validation of the data and the derived products.Many types of imagery sensors exist for remote sensing tasks. Apart from the different technologies, the need for a standardization of the various sensor types has different levels of priority. In order to meet those requirements, ISOŒæ19159 has been split into more than one part. Part 1 covers optical sensors, i.e. airborne photogrammetric cameras and spaceborne optical sensors. Part 2 is intended to cover laser scanning, also known as LIDAR (Light detection and ranging).Parts 3 and 4 are planned to cover RADAR (radio detection and ranging) with the subtopics SAR (synthetic aperture radar) and InSAR (interferometric SAR) as well as SONAR (sound detection and ranging) that is applied in hydrography."

The image data capture spatial and spectral measurements are applied for numerous applications ranging from road/town planning to geological mapping. Typical spatial outcomes of the production process are vector maps, Digital Elevation Models, and 3-dimensional city models. There are typically two streams of spectral analysis data, i.e. the statistical method, which includes image segmentation and the physics-based method which relies on characterisation of specific spectral absorption features.In each of the cases the quality of the end products fully depends on the quality of the measuring instruments that has originally sensed the data. The quality of measuring instruments is determined and documented by calibration.A calibration is often a costly and time consuming process. Therefore, a number of different strategies are in place that combine longer time intervals between subsequent calibrations with simplified intermediate calibration procedures that bridge the time gap and still guarantee a traceable level of quality. Those intermediate calibrations are called validations in this part of ISO/TSŒæ19159.The ISOŒæ19159 series standardizes the calibration of remote sensing imagery sensors and the validation of the calibration information and procedures. It does not address the validation of the data and the derived products.Many types of imagery sensors exist for remote sensing tasks. Apart from the different technologies the need for a standardization of the various sensor types has different levels of priority. In order to meet those requirements, the ISOŒæ19159 series has been split into more than one part.This part of ISO/TSŒæ19159 covers the airborne land lidar sensor (light detection and ranging). It includes the data capture and the calibration. The result of a lidar data capture is a lidar cloud according to the ISOŒæ19156:2011. The bathymetric lidar is not included in the ISOŒæ19159 series.ISOŒæ19159-3 and ISOŒæ19159-4 are planned to cover RADAR (Radio detection and ranging) with the subtopics SAR (Synthetic Aperture RADAR) and InSAR (Interferometric SAR) as well as SONAR (Sound detection and ranging) that is applied in hydrography."

This International Standard defines a äóìmapäóù to be a portrayal of geographic information as a digital image file suitable for display on a computer screen. A map is not the data itself. WMS-produced maps are generally rendered in a pictorial format such as PNG, GIF or JPEG, or occasionally as vector-based graphical elements in Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) or Web Computer Graphics Metafile (WebCGM) formats.This International Standard defines three operations: one returns service-level metadata; another returns a map whose geographic and dimensional parameters are well-defined; and an optional third operation returns information about particular features shown on a map. Web Map Service operations can be invoked using a standard web browser by submitting requests in the form of Uniform Resource Locators (URLs). The content of such URLs depends on which operation is requested. In particular, when requesting a map the URL indicates what information is to be shown on the map, what portion of the Earth is to be mapped, the desired coordinate reference system, and the output image width and height. When two or more maps are produced with the same geographic parameters and output size, the results can be accurately overlaid to produce a composite map. The use of image formats that support transparent backgrounds (e.g. GIF or PNG) allows underlying maps to be visible. Furthermore, individual maps can be requested from different servers. The Web Map Service thus enables the creation of a network of distributed map servers from which clients can build customized maps. Illustrative examples of map request URLs and their resulting maps are shown in AnnexŒæG.This International Standard applies to a Web Map Service instance that publishes its ability to produce maps rather than its ability to access specific data holdings.

In order for this data to be useful in extraction of geographic information, further processing of the data are needed. Geopositioning, which determines the ground coordinates of an object from image coordinates, is a fundamental processing step. Because of the diversity of sensor types and the lack of a common sensor model standard, data from different producers may contain different parametric information, lack parameters required to describe the sensor that produces the data, or lack ancillary information necessary for geopositioning and analysing the data. Often, a separate software package must be developed to deal with data from each individual sensor or data producer. Standard sensor models and geolocation metadata allow agencies or vendors to develop generalized software products that are applicable to data from multiple data producers or from multiple sensors. With such standards, different producers can describe the geolocation information of their data in the same way, thus promoting interoperability of data between application systems and facilitating data exchange.Part 1 provided a location model and metadata relevant to all sensors. It also included metadata specific to whiskbroom, pushbroom, and frame sensors, and some metadata for Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) sensors. In addition, it provided metadata for functional fit geopositioning, whether the function was part of a correspondence model or a true replacement model. It also provided a schema for these metadata elements. Comments on Part 1 stated that metadata needed to be specified for additional sensors. The technology of such sensors has now become sufficiently mature that standardization is now possible. This Technical Specification extends the specification of the set of metadata elements required for geolocation by providing physical sensor models for LIght Detection And Ranging (lidar) and SOund Navigation And Ranging (sonar), and it presents a more detailed set of elements for SAR.

In early development, users were only äóìconsumingäóù location-based content, but with ever increasingly sophisticated mobile hardware devices and the ever expanding extent of telecommunications networking and sensor web enabled infrastructure, mobile users are now able to create many types of geographic data. Creation of content can be on an individual level, using a coordinate location to enable navigation to a new cafí© described in a blog entry, or as a collaborative effort, such as collecting GPS tracks and incorporating them into the Open Street Map project.Smaller devices, embedded systems, wireless communication, and sensor networks (ubiquitous computing technologies) require methods of handling geographic information in terms of both production and consumption. Beyond the previously limited public consumption of geographic information, ubiquitous computing technologies provide the infrastructure for the general public to produce, distribute, and consume geographic information. These concepts are manifested as äóìseamless access from anywhere and at any time to easy-to-use geographic information and servicesäóù. We refer to these concepts as Ubiquitous Public Access to geographic information.The goal of ubiquitous public access to geographic information (UPA-to-GI) is to make the user experience of any äóìsmartäóù device intuitive to understand, along with being easy to use. To achieve this goal, contextual information that is gathered from varied sources is managed efficiently within the UPA architecture. Therefore, systems or services for UPA to geographic information need to support a delivery mechanism of contextual information.This International Standard defines the requirements of standardization for systems and services supporting ubiquitous public access to geographic information, and describes a comprehensive set of fundamental facets that specify an abstract description of the elements for UPA to geographic information.This International Standard further establishes a series of models comprised as a conceptual framework that, when implemented, will support the development of a set of systems and services for enabling ubiquitous public access to geographic information. In a UPA environment, general users are no longer only passive consumers of geographic information, but rather active participants in several steps of the data and information management lifecycle such as collection, creation and capture, and/or use and dissemination.Ubiquitous public access to geographic information might be thought of as a type of geographic information service. However, the currently available standards used in mobile environments are based on web technologies which are not efficient enough to handle the requirements of UPA. In order to provide relevant geographic information to users, the context of the users is described.The reference model specified here defines a group of models which form a framework that supports methods of extracting geographically explicit context information from varied information sources, such as a lexicon, photos, videos, and others sources. Additional models in the framework specify how geographic data produced and distributed by the general public can be semantically linked to meet the useräó»s contextual requests, and how heterogeneous geographic content can be seamlessly accessed, integrated, and provided to a user regardless of the kind of device the user operates."

38,"3.3.1 Polar Scout Trade Space AnalysisFour broad range of solutions were considered in the ASAP trade space analysis: terrestrial, maritime, airborne, and space-based. To assess the alternatives, the trade study examined a 200 by 200 NMI area 100 NM north of Barrow, Alaska, and the entire Juneau Alaska region. Each option was assessed by its ability to provide continuous coverage (24 hours per day, seven days per week) and provide a minimum of a 30 minute revisit time.Each alternative was assessed in the following areas:Platform acquisition costAccess to area of interestTechnical maturity/feasibility3.3.1.1 Preferred AlternativeWithin each solution category (terrestrial, maritime, airborne, and space-based) many potential configurations were constructed and assessed. The space-based solutions using CubeSats proved to be the optimal solution in the ability to provide a 30-minute revisit and were the least expensive alternatives. The best land-based, airborne, and maritime solutions were cost-prohibitive or had insufficient range when compared to the CubeSat space-based solution.3.3.1.2 Logistics ConsiderationsLogistics were not taken into consideration in the trade space analysis since other factors disqualified the non-CubeSat alternatives due to their high cost of acquiring the asset, access to coverage area, and technical maturity.3.3.1.3 Polar Scout Technical Approach3.3.1.3.1 Design, Development, and Integration ApproachPolar Scout is leveraging design and development activities performed under other government or commercial contracts.The 6U CubeSats have been under development for approximately 5 years by ORS. When DHS decided to leverage the ORS 6U CubeSats, the CubeSats had already passed their CDR milestone approximately two years prior. The milestones26 September 2016 Page 23 of 22monitored by DHS will be bus and payload integration activities, bus and payload test activities (e.g. thermal, environmental, etc) and ground processing activities. DHS is leveraging a payload design (by Rincon) that is currently in operations on another CubeSat. This payload will be integrated into the 6U CubeSats. The milestones monitored by DHS will be payload fabrication, payload and bus integration, payload test activities (e.g. thermal, environmental, etc), and payload processing activities. The ASAP Program Manager has decision authority of all 6U flight build, payload integration and test activities, and deviations that are directly related to the operations of the 6U CubeSats.Polar Scout is leveraging the HE360 commercial development effort to acquire additional EPIRB data. For the HE360 contract, the ASAP Program Manager has decision authority for only those design, development, and test activities related to the collection and processing of EPRIB data.A portion of the Analytics contract (RadiantBlue/HumanGeo) will be for RadiantBlue/HumanGeo to perform as the ground integrator for Polar Scout. RadiantBlue/HumanGeo will integrate the EPIRB data from both HE360 and the 6U and provide that data to the USCG and NOAA as agreed upon. To reduce cost and to further separate the Polar Scout and Analytics efforts, the ASAP project is also investigating the possibility of having Rincon integrate the EPRIB data from both the 6Us and HE360.3.3.1.3.2 Communication ApproachThe ASAP Program Manager has stood up several IPTs to monitor the Polar Scout activities. Stakeholders for the 6U CubeSat effort meet weekly in the Technical IPT and the Ground IPT. Through these two IPTs, the Polar Scout Program Manager gains insight into the status, issues, risks, and resolution of challenges. The ASAP Program Manager also has a bi-weekly technical and budget meeting with the 6U prime contractor. In addition the ASAP Program Manager conducts a status meeting with Aerospace to review project status, actions, risks, and open items.For the HE360 contract, HE360 provides monthly status and budget reports. TEMs are held approximately monthly to review the status, issues, risks, and resolution of challenges.3.3.2 AnalyticsFor the RadiantBlue/HumanGeo contract, the Program Manager meets with the team bi-weekly to review the status, issues, risks, and resolution of challenges.

It includes both approaches to standardization: a) process standards, which specify the way in which documentation products are to be developed; and b) documentation product standards, which specify the characteristics and functional requirements of the documentation.The first part of this International Standard covers the user documentation process for designers and developers of documentation. It describes how to establish what information users need, how to determine the way in which that information should be presented to the users, and how to prepare the information and make it available. It is not limited to the design and development phase of the life cycle, but includes activities throughout the information management and documentation processes.The second part of this International Standard provides minimum requirements for the structure, information content, and format of user documentation, including both printed and on-screen documents used in the work environment by users of systems containing software. It applies to printed user manuals, online help, tutorials, and user reference documentation.This International Standard neither encourages nor discourages the use of either printed or electronic (on-screen) media for documentation, or of particular documentation development or management tools or methodologies.This International Standard may be helpful for developing the following types of documentation, although it does not cover all aspects of them:äó¢ documentation of products other than software;äó¢ multimedia systems using animation, video, and sound;äó¢ computer-based training (CBT) packages and specialized course materials intended primarily for use in formal training programs;äó¢ documentation produced for installers, computer operators, or system administrators who are not end users;äó¢ maintenance documentation describing the internal operation of systems software;äó¢ documentation incorporated into the user interface itself.This International Standard is applicable to documentation designers and developers, including a variety of specialists:äó¢ information designers and architects who plan the structure and format of documentation products in a documentation set;äó¢ usability specialists and business analysts who identify the tasks that the intended users will perform with the software;äó¢ those who develop and edit the written content for user documentation;äó¢ graphic designers with expertise in electronic media;äó¢ user interface designers and ergonomics experts working together to design the presentation of the documentation on the screen.This International Standard may also be consulted by those with other roles and interests in the documentation process:äó¢ managers of the software development process or the documentation process;äó¢ acquirers of documentation prepared by suppliers;äó¢ usability testers, documentation reviewers, subject-matter experts;äó¢ developers of tools for creating on-screen documentation;äó¢ human-factors experts who identify principles for making documentation more accessible and easily used.This International Standard is intended for use in all types of organizations, whether or not a dedicated documentation department is present, and may be used as a basis for local standards and procedures. Readers are assumed to have experience or knowledge of software development or documentation development processes.Users of this International Standard should adopt a style manual for use within their own organizations to complement the guidance provided in the annexes to this International Standard, or adopt an industry-recognized style guide. AnnexŒæA provides guidance for the content of a style guide, and AnnexesŒæB and C provide guidance on style.The order of clauses in this International Standard does not imply that the documentation should be developed in this order or presented to the user in this order.In each clause, the requirements are media-independent, as far as possible. Requirements specific to either print or electronic media are identified as such, particularly in ClauseŒæ12. AnnexŒæD provides guidance for the design of printed documentation.The checklists in AnnexŒæE may be used at each phase of the documentation process to check that the appropriate steps have been carried out and that the finished documentation satisfies quality criteria.The checklists in AnnexesŒæF and G may be used to track conformance with the requirements of this International Standard for documentation processes and products.The bibliography lists works that provide guidance on the processes of managing, preparing, and testing user documentation.",,ISO/IEC 26514:2008(en),"IntroductionAnyone who uses application software needs accurate information about how the software will help the user accomplish a task. The documentation may be the first tangible item that the user sees and therefore influences the useräó»s first impressions of the software product. If the information is supplied in a convenient form and is easy to find and understand, the user can quickly become proficient at using the product. Hence, well-designed documentation not only assists the user and helps to reduce the cost of training and support, but also enhances the reputation of the product, its producer, and its suppliers.Although software developers aim to design user interfaces that behave so intuitively that very little separate documentation is needed, this is rarely possible. Todayäó»s software offers increasingly robust functionality, not only within applications, but also across applications that intelligently exchange information with one another. Further, most software designs include underlying rules and calculations, or algorithms, that affect the results a user can obtain when using the software. Such underlying programming mechanics are discernable by users, but only through laborious testing. For these reasons and more, user documentation remains an essential component of usable software products.Documentation is often regarded as something done after the software has been implemented. However, for high-quality software documentation, its development should be regarded as an integral part of the software life cycle process. If done properly, documentation or information management is a big enough job to require process planning in its own right.This International Standard was developed to assist users of ISO/IECŒæ15288:2008, Systems and software engineeringŒæäóî System life cycle processes, or ISO/IECŒæ12207:2008, Systems and software engineeringŒæäóî Software life cycle processes, to design and develop documentation as part of the software life cycle processes. It defines the documentation process from the documentation developer's standpoint.NOTE Other International Standards in the ISO/IECŒæ265NN family are in preparation or planned to address the documentation and information management processes from the viewpoints of managers, assessors and testers, and acquirers and suppliers.In addition to defining a standard process, this International Standard also covers the documentation product. This International Standard specifies the structure, content, and format for documentation, and also provides informative guidance for user documentation style.Earlier standards tended to view the results of the documentation process as a single book or multivolume set: a one-time deliverable. Increasingly, documentation designers recognize that most user documentation is now produced from managed re-use of previously developed information (single-source documentation), adapted for new software versions or presentation in various on-screen and printed media.

It provides requirements for strategy, planning, performance, and control for documentation managers. It specifies procedures for managing user documentation throughout the software life cycle. It also includes requirements for key documents produced for user documentation management, including documentation plans and documentation management plans.This International Standard provides an overview of the software documentation and information management processes which are specialized for user documentation in this International Standard. It also presents aspects of portfolio planning and content management for user documentation. Specifically, it addresses the following:äó¢ management requirements in starting a project, including setting up procedures and specifications, establishing infrastructure, and building a team, with examples of roles needed on a user documentation team;äó¢ measurements and estimates needed for management control;äó¢ the application of management control to user documentation work;äó¢ the use of supporting processes such as change management, schedule and cost control, resource management, quality management and process improvement.The works listed in the Bibliography provide guidance on the processes of managing, preparing, and testing user documentation.NOTE 1: Related standards of value to documentation managers and others involved in the process include ISO/IECŒæ26514:2008, Systems and software engineeringŒæäóî Requirements for designers and developers of user documentation (also available as IEEE Std 26514-2010, IEEE Standard for Adoption of ISO/IECŒæ26514:2008, Systems and Software EngineeringŒæäóî Requirements for Designers and Developers of User Documentation); ISO/IECŒæ26513:2009, Systems and software engineeringŒæäóî Requirements for testers and reviewers of user documentation (also available as IEEE Std 26513-2010, IEEE Standard for Adoption of ISO/IECŒæ26513:2009, Systems and Software EngineeringŒæäóî Requirements for Testers and Reviewers of User Documentation); and ISO/IEC/IEEEŒæ26512:2011, Systems and software engineeringŒæäóî Requirements for acquirers and suppliers of user documentation.This International Standard is applicable for use by managers of user documentation projects or organizations with information designers and documentation developers. This International Standard may also be consulted by those with other roles and interests in the documentation process:äó¢ managers of the software development process;äó¢ acquirers of documentation prepared by suppliers;äó¢ experienced writers who develop the written content for user documentation;äó¢ developers of tools for creating on-screen documentation;äó¢ human-factors experts who identify principles for making documentation more accessible and easily used;äó¢ graphic designers with expertise in electronic media;äó¢ user interface designers and ergonomics experts working together to design the presentation of the documentation on the screen.This International Standard may be applied to manage the following types of documentation, although it does not cover all aspects of them:äó¢ documentation for user assistance, training, marketing, and systems documentation for product design and development, based on reuse of user documentation topics;äó¢ documentation of products other than software;äó¢ multimedia marketing presentations using animation, video, and sound;äó¢ computer-based training (CBT) packages and specialized course materials intended primarily for use in formal training programs;äó¢ maintenance documentation describing the internal operation of systems software.NOTEŒæ2: ISO/IEC/IEEEŒæ15289:2011 provides more detailed content for life-cycle process information items (documentation).",,ISO/IEC/IEEE 26511:2011(en),"IntroductionEffective management of the software user documentation tasks is essential in order to ensure that documentation is usable, accurate, delivered when needed by the users, produced efficiently, and maintained consistent with the software. This International Standard addresses the management of user documentation in relation to both initial development and subsequent releases of the software and user documentation.Anyone who uses application software needs accurate information about how the software will help the user accomplish a task. The documentation can be the first tangible item that the user sees, and if so, it can influence the useräó»s first impressions of the product. If the information is supplied in a convenient form and is easy to find and understand, the users can quickly become proficient at using the product. Hence, a well-managed documentation process not only assists the user and helps to reduce the cost of training and support, but also enhances the reputation of the product, its producer, and its suppliers.Although many software designers aim to have user interfaces that behave so intuitively that very little separate documentation is needed, this approach is rarely possible in practice. User documentation is an essential component of usable software products.Documentation is often regarded as something done after the software has been implemented. However, for quality software documentation, its development should be regarded as an integral part of the software life-cycle process from the planning and design stages onwards. If done properly, documentation or information management is a big enough job to require process planning in its own right.This International Standard was developed to assist users of ISO/IECŒæ15288:2008 (IEEE Std 15288-2008), Systems and software engineeringŒæäóî System life cycle processes, or ISO/IECŒæ12207:2008 (IEEE Std 12207-2008), Systems and software engineeringŒæäóî Software life cycle processes, to manage software user documentation as part of the software life cycle. This International Standard defines the documentation process from the manager's standpoint. It was developed to assist those who provide input to, perform, and evaluate user documentation management.NOTE: Other International Standards in the ISO/IECŒæ265NN family address the documentation and information management processes from the viewpoint of documentation designers/developers, testers and reviewers, and acquirers and suppliers.This International Standard applies to people or organizations producing suites of documentation, to those undertaking a single documentation project, and for documentation produced internally as well as to documentation contracted to outside service organizations. Beyond the development and production of a user manual, help system, or set of documentation for a single software product, it applies to a broader range of documentation management situations, including user documentation for those who install, implement, administer, and operate software for end users. Frequently, user documentation managers are responsible for the development and reuse of information (content management) for:äó¢ multiple updates of user documentation as the software version is updated;äó¢ multiple reuses or adaptations of information to support related software products;äó¢ multiple translated or localized versions of user documentation;äó¢ a portfolio of unrelated documentation projects being managed concurrently within an organization.This International Standard is not intended to advocate the use of either printed or electronic (on-screen) media for documentation, or of any particular information management, content management, documentation testing, or project management tools or protocols. The requirements are media-independent, as far as possible. This International Standard may be applied to user documentation for systems including software as well as to software user documentation."

It addresses both available approaches to standardization: a) process standards, which specify the way that documentation products are to be acquired and supplied; and b) documentation product standards, which specify the characteristics and functional requirements of the documentation.As defined in ISO/IECŒæ12207:2008 (IEEE Std 12207-2008) and ISO/IECŒæ15288:2008 (IEEE Std 15288-2008), the acquisition and supply activities comprise the agreement processes of the software life cycle. Acquisition and supply of user documentation and user documentation services are specializations of those processes. User documentation services can be acquired and supplied for any part of the software documentation management or information management process, such as:äó¢ documentation or information management;äó¢ information design and development;äó¢ documentation editing and review coordination;äó¢ documentation testing, particularly usability testing;äó¢ documentation production and packaging;äó¢ documentation distribution and delivery;äó¢ advice on the selection and implementation of documentation tools and supporting systems;äó¢ documentation process improvement.This International Standard provides an overview of the software user documentation and information management processes which may require acquisition and supply of software user documentation products and services.

It defines the documentation process from the acquireräó»s standpoint and the supplieräó»s standpoint. The accurate description of the requirements for user documentation is essential in order to ensure that the documentation meets the needs of its users. This International Standard addresses the identification, definition, and fulfillment of user documentation requirements as part of the acquisition and supply processes.This International Standard covers the requirements for information items used in the acquisition of user documentation products: the Acquisition Plan, Document Specification, Statement of Work, Request for Proposals, and the Proposal. It also discusses the use of a Documentation Management Plan and a Document Plan as they arise in the acquisition and supply processes.This International Standard is independent of the software tools that can be used to produce documentation, and applies to both printed documentation and on-screen documentation. Much of its guidance is applicable to user documentation for systems including hardware as well as software.Earlier standards tended to view the results of the documentation process as a single book or multi-volume set: a one-time deliverable. Increasingly, documentation acquirers and suppliers recognize that most user documentation is now produced from managed re-use of previously developed information (single-source documentation) adapted for new software versions, or presentation in various on-screen and printed media. While this International Standard does not describe how to set up a content management system, it is applicable for documentation organizations practising single-source documentation, as well as for acquirers and suppliers of one-time deliverables.Anyone who uses application software needs accurate information about how the software will help the user accomplish a task. The documentation can be the first tangible item that the user sees, and so influences the useräó»s first impressions of the software product.

Therefore, well-designed documentation not only assists the user and helps to reduce the cost of training and support, but also enhances the reputation of the product, its producer, and its suppliers.Although software developers intend to design user interfaces that behave so intuitively that very little separate documentation is needed, this is rarely possible. Todayäó»s software offers increasingly robust functionality, not only within applications, but also across applications which intelligently exchange information with one another. Further, most software includes underlying rules and calculations, or algorithms that affect the results a user can obtain when using the software. These underlying programming mechanics are discernable by users, but only through laborious testing. For these and other reasons, user documentation remains an essential component of usable software products.Documentation is often regarded as something done after the software has been implemented. However, for high-quality software documentation, its development needs to be regarded as an integral part of the software life cycle. In fact, quality documentation or information management services are important enough to require specific planning.Related standards for those acquiring and supplying software user documentation include ISO/IECŒæ26514:2008 (IEEE Std 26514-2010), Systems and software engineeringŒæäóî Requirements for designers and developers of user documentation, and ISO/IECŒæ26513:2009 (IEEE Std 26513-2010), Systems and software engineeringŒæäóî Requirements for testers and reviewers of user documentation.

",Information technology äóî Programming languages äóî Ada,https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#!iso:std:61507:en,,,,ISO/IEC 8652:2012(en),"IntroductionDesign GoalsAda was originally designed with three overriding concerns: program reliability and maintenance, programming as a human activity, and efficiency. The 1995 revision to the language was designed to provide greater flexibility and extensibility, additional control over storage management and synchronization, and standardized packages oriented toward supporting important application areas, while at the same time retaining the original emphasis on reliability, maintainability, and efficiency. This third edition provides further flexibility and adds more standardized packages within the framework provided by the 1995 revision.The need for languages that promote reliability and simplify maintenance is well established. Hence emphasis was placed on program readability over ease of writing. For example, the rules of the language require that program variables be explicitly declared and that their type be specified. Since the type of a variable is invariant, compilers can ensure that operations on variables are compatible with the properties intended for objects of the type. Furthermore, error-prone notations have been avoided, and the syntax of the language avoids the use of encoded forms in favor of more English-like constructs. Finally, the language offers support for separate compilation of program units in a way that facilitates program development and maintenance, and which provides the same degree of checking between units as within a unit.Concern for the human programmer was also stressed during the design. Above all, an attempt was made to keep to a relatively small number of underlying concepts integrated in a consistent and systematic way while continuing to avoid the pitfalls of excessive involution. The design especially aims to provide language constructs that correspond intuitively to the normal expectations of users.Like many other human activities, the development of programs is becoming ever more decentralized and distributed. Consequently, the ability to assemble a program from independently produced software components continues to be a central idea in the design. The concepts of packages, of private types, and of generic units are directly related to this idea, which has ramifications in many other aspects of the language. An allied concern is the maintenance of programs to match changing requirements; type extension and the hierarchical library enable a program to be modified while minimizing disturbance to existing tested and trusted components.No language can avoid the problem of efficiency. Languages that require over-elaborate compilers, or that lead to the inefficient use of storage or execution time, force these inefficiencies on all machines and on all programs. Every construct of the language was examined in the light of present implementation techniques. Any proposed construct whose implementation was unclear or that required excessive machine resources was rejected.Language SummaryAn Ada program is composed of one or more program units. Program units may be subprograms (which define executable algorithms), packages (which define collections of entities), task units (which define concurrent computations), protected units (which define operations for the coordinated sharing of data between tasks), or generic units (which define parameterized forms of packages and subprograms). Each program unit normally consists of two parts: a specification, containing the information that must be visible to other units, and a body, containing the implementation details, which need not be visible to other units. Most program units can be compiled separately.This distinction of the specification and body, and the ability to compile units separately, allows a program to be designed, written, and tested as a set of largely independent software components.An Ada program will normally make use of a library of program units of general utility. The language provides means whereby individual organizations can construct their own libraries. All libraries are structured in a hierarchical manner; this enables the logical decomposition of a subsystem into individual components. The text of a separately compiled program unit must name the library units it requires.Program UnitsA subprogram is the basic unit for expressing an algorithm. There are two kinds of subprograms: procedures and functions. A procedure is the means of invoking a series of actions. For example, it may read data, update variables, or produce some output. It may have parameters, to provide a controlled means of passing information between the procedure and the point of call. A function is the means of invoking the computation of a value. It is similar to a procedure, but in addition will return a result.A package is the basic unit for defining a collection of logically related entities. For example, a package can be used to define a set of type declarations and associated operations. Portions of a package can be hidden from the user, thus allowing access only to the logical properties expressed by the package specification.Subprogram and package units may be compiled separately and arranged in hierarchies of parent and child units giving fine control over visibility of the logical properties and their detailed implementation.A task unit is the basic unit for defining a task whose sequence of actions may be executed concurrently with those of other tasks. Such tasks may be implemented on multicomputers, multiprocessors, or with interleaved execution on a single processor. A task unit may define either a single executing task or a task type permitting the creation of any number of similar tasks.A protected unit is the basic unit for defining protected operations for the coordinated use of data shared between tasks. Simple mutual exclusion is provided automatically, and more elaborate sharing protocols can be defined. A protected operation can either be a subprogram or an entry. A protected entry specifies a Boolean expression (an entry barrier) that must be True before the body of the entry is executed. A protected unit may define a single protected object or a protected type permitting the creation of several similar objects.Declarations and StatementsThe body of a program unit generally contains two parts: a declarative part, which defines the logical entities to be used in the program unit, and a sequence of statements, which defines the execution of the program unit.The declarative part associates names with declared entities. For example, a name may denote a type, a constant, a variable, or an exception. A declarative part also introduces the names and parameters of other nested subprograms, packages, task units, protected units, and generic units to be used in the program unit.The sequence of statements describes a sequence of actions that are to be performed. The statements are executed in succession (unless a transfer of control causes execution to continue from another place).An assignment statement changes the value of a variable. A procedure call invokes execution of a procedure after associating any actual parameters provided at the call with the corresponding formal parameters.Case statements and if statements allow the selection of an enclosed sequence of statements based on the value of an expression or on the value of a condition.The loop statement provides the basic iterative mechanism in the language. A loop statement specifies that a sequence of statements is to be executed repeatedly as directed by an iteration scheme, or until an exit statement is encountered.A block statement comprises a sequence of statements preceded by the declaration of local entities used by the statements.Certain statements are associated with concurrent execution. A delay statement delays the execution of a task for a specified duration or until a specified time. An entry call statement is written as a procedure call statement; it requests an operation on a task or on a protected object, blocking the caller until the operation can be performed. A called task may accept an entry call by executing a corresponding accept statement, which specifies the actions then to be performed as part of the rendezvous with the calling task. An entry call on a protected object is processed when the corresponding entry barrier evaluates to true, whereupon the body of the entry is executed. The requeue statement permits the provision of a service as a number of related activities with preference control. One form of the select statement allows a selective wait for one of several alternative rendezvous. Other forms of the select statement allow conditional or timed entry calls and the asynchronous transfer of control in response to some triggering event.Execution of a program unit may encounter error situations in which normal program execution cannot continue. For example, an arithmetic computation may exceed the maximum allowed value of a number, or an attempt may be made to access an array component by using an incorrect index value. To deal with such error situations, the statements of a program unit can be textually followed by exception handlers that specify the actions to be taken when the error situation arises. Exceptions can be raised explicitly by a raise statement.Data TypesEvery object in the language has a type, which characterizes a set of values and a set of applicable operations. The main classes of types are elementary types (comprising enumeration, numeric, and access types) and composite types (including array and record types).An enumeration type defines an ordered set of distinct enumeration literals, for exampleŒæa list of states or an alphabet of characters. The enumeration types Boolean, Character, Wide_Character, and Wide_Wide_Character are predefined.Numeric types provide a means of performing exact or approximate numerical computations. Exact computations use integer types, which denote sets of consecutive integers. Approximate computations use either fixed point types, with absolute bounds on the error, or floating point types, with relative bounds on the error. The numeric types Integer, Float, and Duration are predefined.Composite types allow definitions of structured objects with related components. The composite types in the language include arrays and records. An array is an object with indexed components of the same type. A record is an object with named components of possibly different types. Task and protected types are also forms of composite types. The array types String, Wide_String, and Wide_Wide_String are predefined.Record, task, and protected types may have special components called discriminants which parameterize the type. Variant record structures that depend on the values of discriminants can be defined within a record type.Access types allow the construction of linked data structures. A value of an access type represents a reference to an object declared as aliased or to an object created by the evaluation of an allocator. Several variables of an access type may designate the same object, and components of one object may designate the same or other objects. Both the elements in such linked data structures and their relation to other elements can be altered during program execution. Access types also permit references to subprograms to be stored, passed as parameters, and ultimately dereferenced as part of an indirect call.Private types permit restricted views of a type. A private type can be defined in a package so that only the logically necessary properties are made visible to the users of the type. The full structural details that are externally irrelevant are then only available within the package and any child units.From any typeŒæa new type may be defined by derivation. A type, together with its derivatives (both direct and indirect) form a derivation class. Class-wide operations may be defined that accept as a parameter an operand of any type in a derivation class. For record and private types, the derivatives may be extensions of the parent type. Types that support these object-oriented capabilities of class-wide operations and type extension must be tagged, so that the specific type of an operand within a derivation class can be identified at run time. When an operation of a tagged type is applied to an operand whose specific type is not known until run time, implicit dispatching is performed based on the tag of the operand.Interface types provide abstract models from which other interfaces and types may be composed and derived. This provides a reliable form of multiple inheritance. Interface types may also be implemented by task types and protected types thereby enabling concurrent programming and inheritance to be merged.The concept of a type is further refined by the concept of a subtype, whereby a user can constrain the set of allowed values of a type. Subtypes can be used to define subranges of scalar types, arrays with a limited set of index values, and records and private types with particular discriminant values.Other FacilitiesAspect clauses can be used to specify the mapping between types and features of an underlying machine. For example, the user can specify that objects of a given type must be represented with a given number of bits, or that the components of a record are to be represented using a given storage layout. Other features allow the controlled use of low level, nonportable, or implementation-dependent aspects, including the direct insertion of machine code.The predefined environment of the language provides for input-output and other capabilities by means of standard library packages. Input-output is supported for values of user-defined as well as of predefined types. Standard means of representing values in display form are also provided.The predefined standard library packages provide facilities such as string manipulation, containers of various kinds (vectors, lists, maps, etc.), mathematical functions, random number generation, and access to the execution environment.The specialized annexes define further predefined library packages and facilities with emphasis on areas such as real-time scheduling, interrupt handling, distributed systems, numerical computation, and high-integrity systems.Finally, the language provides a powerful means of parameterization of program units, called generic program units. The generic parameters can be types and subprograms (as well as objects and packages) and so allow general algorithms and data structures to be defined that are applicable to all types of a given class.Language ChangesThis International Standard replaces the second edition of 1995. It modifies the previous edition by making changes and additions that improve the capability of the language and the reliability of programs written in the language. This edition incorporates the changes from Amendment 1 (ISO/IECŒæ8652:1995:AMD 1:2007), which were designed to improve the portability of programs, interfacing to other languages, and both the object-oriented and real-time capabilities.Significant changes originating in Amendment 1 are incorporated:äó¢ Support for program text is extended to cover the entire ISO/IECŒæ10646:2003 repertoire. Execution support now includes the 32-bit character set. See subclausesŒæ2.1, 3.5.2, 3.6.3, A.1, A.3, and A.4.äó¢ The object-oriented model has been improved by the addition of an interface facility which provides multiple inheritance and additional flexibility for type extensions. See subclausesŒæ3.4, 3.9, and 7.3. An alternative notation for calling operations more akin to that used in other languages has also been added. See subclauseŒæ4.1.3.äó¢ Access types have been further extended to unify properties such as the ability to access constants and to exclude null values. See clauseŒæ3.10. Anonymous access types are now permitted more freely and anonymous access-to-subprogram types are introduced. See subclausesŒæ3.3, 3.6, 3.10, and 8.5.1.äó¢ The control of structure and visibility has been enhanced to permit mutually dependent references between units and finer control over access from the private part of a package. See subclausesŒæ3.10.1 and 10.1.2. In addition, limited types have been made more useful by the provision of aggregates, constants, and constructor functions. See subclausesŒæ4.3, 6.5, and 7.5.äó¢ The predefined environment has been extended to include additional time and calendar operations, improved string handling, a comprehensive container library, file and directory management, and access to environment variables. See subclausesŒæ9.6.1, A.4, A.16, A.17, and A.18.äó¢ Two of the Specialized Needs Annexes have been considerably enhanced:äó¢ The Real-Time Systems Annex now includes the Ravenscar profile for high-integrity systems, further dispatching policies such as Round Robin and Earliest Deadline First, support for timing events, and support for control of CPU time utilization. See subclausesŒæD.2, D.13, D.14, and D.15.äó¢ The Numerics Annex now includes support for real and complex vectors and matrices as previously defined in ISO/IECŒæ13813:1997 plus further basic operations for linear algebra. See subclauseŒæG.3.äó¢ The overall reliability of the language has been enhanced by a number of improvements. These include new syntax which detects accidental overloading, as well as pragmas for making assertions and giving better control over the suppression of checks. See subclausesŒæ6.1, 11.4.2, and 11.5.In addition, this third edition makes enhancements to address two important issues, namely, the particular problems of multiprocessor architectures, and the need to further increase the capabilities regarding assertions for correctness. It also makes additional changes and additions that improve the capability of the language and the reliability of programs written in the language.The following significant changes with respect to the 1995 edition as amended by Amendment 1 are incorporated:äó¢ New syntax (the aspect specification) is introduced to enable properties to be specified for various entities in a more structured manner than through pragmas. See subclauseŒæ13.1.1.äó¢ The concept of assertions introduced in the 2005 edition is extended with the ability to specify preconditions and postconditions for subprograms, and invariants for private types. The concept of constraints in defining subtypes is supplemented with subtype predicates that enable subsets to be specified other than as simple ranges. These properties are all indicated using aspect specifications. See subclausesŒæ3.2.4, 6.1.1, and 7.3.2.äó¢ New forms of expressions are introduced. These are if expressions, case expressions, quantified expressions, and expression functions. As well as being useful for programming in general by avoiding the introduction of unnecessary assignments, they are especially valuable in conditions and invariants since they avoid the need to introduce auxiliary functions. See subclausesŒæ4.5.7, 4.5.8, and 6.8. Membership tests are also made more flexible. See subclausesŒæ4.4 and 4.5.2.äó¢ A number of changes are made to subprogram parameters. Functions may now have parameters of all modes. In order to mitigate consequent (and indeed existing) problems of inadvertent order dependence, rules are introduced to reduce aliasing. A parameter may now be explicitly marked as aliased and the type of a parameter may be incomplete in certain circumstances. See subclausesŒæ3.10.1, 6.1, and 6.4.1.äó¢ The use of access types is now more flexible. The rules for accessibility and certain conversions are improved. See subclausesŒæ3.10.2, 4.5.2, 4.6, and 8.6. Furthermore, better control of storage pools is provided. See subclauseŒæ13.11.4.äó¢ The Real-Time Systems Annex now includes facilities for defining domains of processors and assigning tasks to them. Improvements are made to scheduling and budgeting facilities. See subclausesŒæD.10.1, D.14, and D.16.äó¢ A number of important improvements are made to the standard library. These include packages for conversions between strings and UTF encodings, and classification functions for wide and wide wide characters. Internationalization is catered for by a package giving locale information. See subclausesŒæA.3, A.4.11, and A.19. The container library is extended to include bounded forms of the existing containers and new containers for indefinite objects, multiway trees, and queues. See subclauseŒæA.18.äó¢ Finally, certain features are added primarily to ease the use of containers, such as the ability to iterate over all elements in a container without having to encode the iteration. These can also be used for iteration over arrays, and within quantified expressions.

The modes of operation described herein are specified for both enciphering and deciphering operations. The modes described in this Technical Report are implementations of the block cipher modes of operation specified in ISO/IECŒæ10116 using the Triple DEA algorithm (TDEA) specified in ISO/IECŒæ18033-3.The TDEA modes of operation may be used in both wholesale and retail financial applications. The use of this Technical Report provides the basis for the interoperability of products and facilitates the development of application standards that use the TDEA modes of operation. This Technical Report is intended for use with other ISO standards using DEA.,,ISO/TR 19038:2005(en),"IntroductionIn order to significantly strengthen DEA (Data Encryption Algorithm) and extend its useful lifetime, the use of Triple Data Encryption Algorithm (TDEA) modes of operation has been recommended. These TDEA modes of operation not only provide greatly increased cryptographic protection, but because they are based on DEA, the TDEA learning curve for users and vendors is reduced. Since certain TDEA modes of operation can be made backward compatible with existing DEA modes of operation, the financial community may leverage its investment in standard DEA technology by using TDEA to extend its secure lifetime.Each mode of operation provides different benefits and has different characteristics. The selection, implementation and use of a particular mode of operation is dependent upon the security requirements, risk acceptance posture, and operational needs of the financial institution and are beyond the scope of this Technical Report. This Technical Report is necessary to provide the basis for interoperability between different parties using any of the TDEA modes specified herein, provided that they use the same mode of operation and share the same secret cryptographic key(s).This Technical Report does not replace the Data Encryption Algorithm Standard nor the Triple Data Encryption Algorithm specified in ISO/IECŒæ18033. DEA is the basis for the TDEA modes of operation. TDEA provides increased security in keeping with advances in computing technology and cryptanalytic techniques. TDEA may be implemented in hardware, software or a combination of hardware and software.This Technical Report provides implementation guidelines for the modes of operation specified in ISO/IECŒæ10116.It is the responsibility of the financial institution to put overall security procedures in place with the necessary controls to ensure that the process is implemented in a secure manner. Furthermore, the process should be audited to ensure compliance with the procedures."

In the context of the ISO/IECŒæ29155 series, the äóìobject of interestäóù is the performance of information technology (IT) project, and the characteristic is a particular aspect of an IT project such as productivity.Benchmarking is one of the fastest-growing techniques in the area of IT project management. Instances of IT project performance benchmarking are initiated and conducted for various reasons. Among the most common reasons are the following:a) the need to compare project productivity between similar industries;b) the need to compare productivity between different project types and technologies;c) the need to find the most effective targets for IT development process improvement;d) the need to compare productivity between different suppliers;e) the need to improve project management maturity;f) the need to improve project estimation capability.Much has been written regarding the trials of establishing IT project performance benchmarking, and statistics bear witness to the high failure rate of measurement and benchmarking programs. The most probable causes for failure have been disappointment in the benchmarking outcomes due to a lack of alignment between the selected measurements and business goals, and the misunderstanding of project level measurements in relation to program and portfolio management levels. When there is no alignment between executed measurements and provided outcomes, unnecessary effort is required from the IT project teams collecting the project data. The result is decreased motivation to continue and institutionalize benchmarking.As is shown in FigureŒæ1, the ISO/IECŒæ29155 series consists of multiple parts.äóî ISO/IECŒæ29155-1 provides the overall framework model for IT project performance benchmarking.

Understanding and interpreting these sections will require technical background in human factors or usability engineering for optimal use.The report format assumes sound practice [1, 2] has been followed in the design and execution of the test. Test procedures which produce measures that summarize usability should be used, i.e. the test is summative in nature. Some usability evaluation methods, such as formative tests, are intended to identify problems rather than produce measures; the format is not structured to support the results of such testing methods.",,ISO/IEC 25062:2006(en),"IntroductionUsability of software is a key factor in predicting successful deployment of that softŒ_ware. Software manufacturers subject software to usability testing at various stages in a productäó»s development; some companies that purchase software also test prodŒ_ucts for usability before making purchasing decisions. Testing often involves (1) subŒ_jects who are representative of the target population of users of the software, (2) representative tasks, and (3) measures of efficiency, effectiveness and subjective satisfaction. When this type of experimental situation exists, the testing is termed summative, i.e., the results can be expressed as statistically meaningful measures of central tendency (e.g. mean or median) and variability (e.g. standard deviation). The Common Industry Format (CIF) for Usability Test Reports is intended for use by usability professionals to report the results of summative usability testing.The CIF standardizes the types of information that are captured about testing with users. The level of detail allows the same or another organization to replicate the test procedure. The major variables are user demographics, task descriptions, context of the test, including the equipment used, the environment in which the test is conductŒ_ed, and the protocol by which the subjects and the test administrator(s) interact, as well as the particular metrics chosen to code the findings of the study.The CIF is intended to replace the proprietary formats employed by companies that perform usability testing, both vendors and purchasers of software. Until now there has been no standard format for reporting usability testing results. Advantages of usŒ_ing a standardized reporting format include (1) a reduction in training time for usabiliŒ_ty staff since an individual only needs to learn to use one form regardless of how many companies he works for and (2) enhanced potential for increased communiŒ_cation between vendors and purchasing organizations since readers of CIF-compliŒ_ant reports will share a common language and expectations.The purpose of this International Standard is to facilitate incorporation of usability as part of the procurement decision-making process for interactive software products so that it is easier to judge whether a product meets usability goals. ExamŒ_ples of decisions include purchasing, upgrading and automating. It provides a comŒ_mon format for human factors engineers and usability professionals in supplier companies to report the methods and results of usability tests to customer organizaŒ_tions.AudienceThe Common Industry Format (CIF) is meant to be used by usability professionals within supplier organizations to generate reports that can be used by customer orgaŒ_nizations in the CIF report. The CIF is also meant to be used by customer organizaŒ_tions to verify that a particular report is CIF-compliant. The Usability Test Report itself is intended for two types of readers:äóî Usability professionals in customer organizations who are evaluating both the technical merit of usability tests and the usability of the products; andäóî Other technical professionals and managers who are using the test results to make business decisions.The CIF may also be used within a single organization if a formal report of a summative usability test needs to be generated. In this case additional material such as a list of detailed findings may be included.The report is in two main sections, an Executive Summary and a main body. The main body contains the Methods and Results sections and is aimed at the first audiŒ_ence above. These sections (1) describe the test methodology and results in sufficient techŒ_nical detail to allow replication by another organization if the test is repeated, and (2) support application of test data to questions about the productäó»s expected costs and benefits. Understanding and interpreting these sections will require technical backŒ_ground in human factors or usability engineering for optimal use. The second audiŒ_ence is directed to the Introduction, which provides summary information for non-usability professionals and managers. The Introduction may also be of general interŒ_est to other computing professionals. Decision makers without usability engineering expertise may find the information in the main body to be useful but should rely on expert interpretation when necessary.OrganizationClauseŒæ1 describes the scope of this specification and the conformance criteria.

IT project performance benchmarking is a combination of several different advanced technologies and practices in the area of quantitative analysis and management. Thus the framework introduced in this part of ISO/IECŒæ29155 can be built on the basis of various standardized key technologies such as:äóî project management (e.g. PMBOK Guide and ISOŒæ10006),äóî systems and software measurements (e.g. ISO/IECŒæ15939),äóî software life cycle processes (e.g. ISO/IECŒæ12207),äóî systems life cycle processes (e.g. ISO/IECŒæ15288),äóî functional size measurement (e.g. ISO/IECŒæ14143 series and related methods),äóî systems and software quality evaluations (e.g. ISO/IECŒæ25000 family and ISO/IECŒæ9126 series).This part of ISO/IECŒæ29155 is designed to conform to the concepts within ISO/IECŒæ12207 (software life cycle processes), ISO/IECŒæ15288 (systems life cycle processes), the ISO/IECŒæ14143 series (functional size measurement), the ISO/IECŒæ15504 series (process assessment), ISO/IECŒæTRŒæ12182 (categorization of software), or ISO/IECŒæ14764 (maintenance of software life cycle processes).IT project performance benchmarking instances are initiated and conducted for various reasons.

54,"Current airport screening protocols rely on identification cards such as driverês licenses to perform identity verification at TSA checkpoints.  In the future, ensuring identity could be even more important if a substantial fraction of the flying public goes through an expedited screening protocol based on information (e.g., travel patterns) associated with passenger identity.  In addition, more adaptive security protocols, in which checked or carry-on baggage screening protocols are closely linked to passenger risk, would require mechanisms for high-confidence association between passengers and their bags.In this task, AF-MIT/LL will conduct a study of existing and feasible near-term identity verification and correlation methods in order to assess advantages and projected vulnerabilities with respect to potential _screening at speed” checkpoint protocols.  Components that will be considered include credential authentication technologies, standoff biometrics, scan-able unique identifiers, and the underlying software architecture and databases required to manage identity-related information.  AF-MIT/LL will perform limited implementation to support the analysis; for instance, evaluation of low-fidelity face matching to verify identity across multiple passenger visits to the same airport may require some testing with actual face images extracted from surveillance video at a range of resolutions.

In recent years, digital face images are used in many applications including human examination as well as computer automated face recognition. Although photographic formats have been standardized in some cases such as for passports and driver licenses, there is a need to define a standard data format of digital face images to allow interoperability among vendors.This part of ISO/IECŒæ19794 is intended to provide a face image format for face recognition applications requiring exchange of face image data. The typical applications are1) human examination of facial images with sufficient resolution to allow a human examiner to ascertain small features such as moles and scars that might be used to verify identity,2) human verification of identity by comparison of persons against facial images,3) computer automated face biometric identification (one-to-many searching), and4) computer automated face biometric verification (one-to-one comparison).To enable many applications on a variety of devices, including devices that have limited resources available for data storage, and to improve face recognition accuracy, this part of ISO/IECŒæ19794 specifies not only a data format, but also scene constraints (lighting, pose, expression, etc.), photographic properties (positioning, camera focus, etc.) and digital image attributes (image resolution, image size, etc.).Several face image types are introduced to define categories that satisfy requirements of some applications:äó¢ Basic: This is the fundamental Face Image Type that specifies a record format including header and representation data. All Face Image Types adhere to the properties of this type. No mandatory scene, photographic and digital requirements are specified for this image type.äó¢ Frontal: A Basic Face Image Type that adheres to additional requirements appropriate for frontal face recognition and/or human examination. Two types of Frontal Face Image Types are defined in this part of ISO/IECŒæ19794, Full Frontal and Token Frontal (or simply Token).äó¢ Full Frontal: A Face Image Type that specifies frontal images with sufficient resolution for human examination as well as reliable computer face recognition. This type of Face Image Type includes the full head with all hair in most cases, as well as neck and shoulders. This image type is suitable for permanent storage of the face information, and it is applicable to portraits for passport, driver license, and äóìmugshotäóù images.äó¢ Token Frontal: A Face Image Type that specifies frontal images with a specific geometric size and eye positioning based on the width and height of the image. This image type is suitable for minimizing the storage requirements for computer face recognition tasks such as verification while still offering vendor independence and human verification (versus human examination which requires more detail) capabilities.äó¢ Post-processed Frontal: Applying digital post-processing to a captured image can modify this image in a way that it is more suitable for automatic face recognition. The Post-processed Frontal Face Image Type is thought of as the interchange format for these kinds of facial images.äó¢ Basic 3D: The Basic 3D Image Type is the base Image Type of all 3D Face Image Types. All 3D Face Image Types obey normative requirements of this image type.äó¢ Full Frontal 3D: The Full Frontal 3D Image Type combines a Full Frontal 2D image with additional 3D information.äó¢ Token Frontal 3D: The Token Frontal 3D Image Type combines a Token Frontal 2D image with additional 3D information.TableŒæ1 shows the relationships between Face Image Types using the notion of inheritance.

In general, this guidance is applicable to the software developed, reviewed, or maintained for any application.Vulnerabilities are described in a generic manner that is applicable to a broad range of programming languages.",,ISO/IEC TR 24772:2013(en),"IntroductionAll programming languages contain constructs that are incompletely specified, exhibit undefined behaviour, are implementation-dependent, or are difficult to use correctly. The use of those constructs may therefore give rise to vulnerabilities, as a result of which, software programs can execute differently than intended by the writer. In some cases, these vulnerabilities can compromise the safety of a system or be exploited by attackers to compromise the security or privacy of a system.This Technical Report is intended to provide guidance spanning multiple programming languages, so that application developers will be better able to avoid the programming constructs that lead to vulnerabilities in software written in their chosen language and their attendant consequences. This guidance can also be used by developers to select source code evaluation tools that can discover and eliminate some constructs that could lead to vulnerabilities in their software or to select a programming language that avoids anticipated problems.It should be noted that this Technical Report is inherently incomplete.

","Information technology äóî Programming languages, their environments and system software interfaces äóî Technical Report on C++ Performance",https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#!iso:std:43351:en,,"1ŒæŒæŒæScopeThe aim of this Technical Report is:äó¢ to give the reader a model of time and space overheads implied by use of various C++Œælanguage and library features,äó¢ to debunk widespread myths about performance problems,äó¢ to present techniques for use of C++Œæin applications where performance matters, andäó¢ to present techniques for implementing C++ŒæStandard language and library facilities to yield efficient code.As far as run-time and space performance are concerned, if you can afford to use C for an application, you can afford to use C++Œæin a style that uses C++äó»s facilities appropriately for that application.This Technical Report first discusses areas where performance issues matter, such as various forms of embedded systems programming and high-performance numerical computation. After that, the main body of the Technical Report considers the basic cost of using language and library facilities, techniques for writing efficient code, and the special needs of embedded systems programming.Performance implications of object-oriented programming are presented. This discussion rests on measurements of key language facilities supporting OOP, such as classes, class member functions, class hierarchies, virtual functions, multiple inheritance, and run-time type information (RTTI). It is demonstrated that, with the exception of RTTI, current C++Œæimplementations can match hand-written low-level code for equivalent tasks. Similarly, the performance implications of generic programming using templates are discussed. Here, however, the emphasis is on techniques for effective use. Error handling using exceptions is discussed based on another set of measurements. Both time and space overheads are discussed. In addition, the predictability of performance of a given operation is considered.The performance implications of IOStreams and Locales are examined in some detail and many generally useful techniques for time and space optimizations are discussed.The special needs of embedded systems programming are presented, including ROMability and predictability. A separate chapter presents general C and C++Œæinterfaces to the basic hardware facilities of embedded systems.Additional research is continuing into techniques for producing efficient C++Œælibraries and programs.

It could even refer to the time necessary to find and fix code defects. Most people are primarily concerned with execution speed, although program footprint and memory usage can be critical for small embedded systems where the program is stored in ROM, or where ROM and RAM are combined on a single chip.Efficiency has been a major design goal for C++Œæfrom the beginning, as has the principle of äóìzero overheadäóù for any feature that is not used in a program. It has been a guiding principle from the earliest days of C++Œæthat äóìyou donäó»t pay for what you donäó»t useäóù.Language features that are never used in a program should not have a cost in extra code size, memory size, or run-time. If there are places where C++Œæcannot guarantee zero overhead for unused features, this Technical Report will attempt to document them. It will also discuss ways in which compiler writers, library vendors, and programmers can minimize or eliminate performance penalties, and will discuss the trade-offs among different methods of implementation.Programming for resource-constrained environments is another focus of this Technical Report Typically, programs that run into resource limits of some kind are either very large or very small. Very large programs, such as database servers, may run into limits of disk space or virtual memory. At the other extreme, an embedded application may be constrained to run in the ROM and RAM space provided by a single chip, perhaps a total of 64K of memory, or even smaller.Apart from the issues of resource limits, some programs must interface with system hardware at a very low level. Historically the interfaces to hardware have been implemented as proprietary extensions to the compiler (often as macros). This has led to the situation that code has not been portable, even for programs written for a given environment, because each compiler for that environment has implemented different sets of extensions."

The Body of Knowledge is subdivided into fifteen software engineering Knowledge Areas (KA) providing an outline of topics. The descriptions in the KAs are designed to discriminate among the various important concepts, permitting readers to find their way quickly to subjects of interest. Upon finding a subject, readers are referred to key papers or books selected because they succinctly present the knowledge.Publication of the 2004 version of this Guide to the Software Engineering Body of Knowledge (SWEBOK 2004)äóîadopted as ISO/IECŒæTRŒæ19759:2005äóîwas a major milestone in establishing software engineering as a recognized engineering discipline. The goal in developing this update to SWEBOK is to improve the currency, readability, consistency, and usability of the Guide. All knowledge areas (KAs) have been updated to reflect changes in software engineering since publication of SWEBOK 2004. Four new foundation KAs and a Software Engineering Professional Practices KA have been added. The Software Engineering Tools and Methods KA has been revised as Software Engineering Models and Methods. Software engineering tools is now a topic in each of the KAs. Three appendices provide the specifications for the KA description, an annotated set of relevant standards for each KA, and a listing of the references cited in the Guide.An emphasis on engineering practice leads the Guide toward a strong relationship with the normative literature. Most of the computer science, information technology and software engineering literature provides information useful to software engineers, but a relatively small portion is normative. A normative document prescribes what an engineer should do in a specified situation rather than providing information that might be helpful. The normative literature is validated by consensus formed among practitioners and is concentrated in standards and related documents. From the beginning, the SWEBOK project was conceived as having a strong relationship to the normative literature of software engineering. The two major standards bodies for software engineering (IEEE Computer Society Software and Systems Engineering Standards Committee and ISO/IEC JTC1/SC7) cooperated in the project.The Guide is oriented toward a variety of audiences, all over the world. It aims to serve public and private organizations in need of a consistent view of software engineering for defining education and training requirements, classifying jobs, developing performance evaluation policies or specifying software development tasks. It also addresses practicing, or managing, software engineers and the officials responsible for making public policy regarding licensing and professional guidelines. In addition, professional societies and educators defining the certification rules, accreditation policies for university curricula, and guidelines for professional practice will benefit from the SWEBOK Guide, as well as the students learning the software engineering profession and educators and trainers engaged in defining curricula and course content."

These devices produce a variety of digital image formats.The American College of Radiology (ACR) and the National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA) formed a joint committee in 1983 to develop a standard to:äóî promote communication of digital image information, regardless of device manufacturer;äóî facilitate the development and expansion of picture archiving and communication systemsŒæ(PACS) that can also interface with other systems of hospital information;äóî allow the creation of diagnostic information databases that can be interrogated by a wide variety of devices distributed geographically.ACR-NEMA standards Publication No. 300-1985, published in 1985, was designated versionŒæ1.0. The standard was followed by two revisions: No. 1, dated OctoberŒæ1986 and No. 2, dated JanuaryŒæ1988. These standards publications specified a hardware interface, a minimum set of software commands, and a consistent set of data formats.ACR-NEMA standards Publication No. 300-1988, published in 1988, was designated version 2.0. It included version 1.0, the published revisions, and additional revisions. It also included new material to provide command support for display devices, to introduce a new hierarchy scheme to identify an image, and to add data elements for increased specificity when describing an image.In 1993, ACR-NEMA/StandardŒæ300 was substantially revised and replaced by this document, designated Digital Imaging and Communications in MedicineŒæ(DICOM). It embodies a number of major enhancements to previous versions of the ACR-NEMA standard, as listed below.äóî It is applicable to a networked environment. The ACR-NEMA standard was applicable in a point-to-point environment only; for operation in a networked environment, a Network Interface UnitŒæ(NIU) was required. DICOM supports operation in a networked environment using the industry standard networking protocol TCP/IP.äóî It is applicable to offline media exchange. The ACR-NEMA standard did not specify a file format or choice of physical media or logical filesystem. DICOM supports operation in an offline media environment using industry standard media such as CD-R, DVD-R and USB and common file systems.äóî It is a service-oriented protocol, specifying the semantics of commands and associated data, and how devices claiming conformance to the DICOM standard react to commands and data being exchanged. Specified services include support for management of the workflow of an imaging department. The ACR-NEMA standard was confined to the transfer of data with only implicit service requirements.äóî It specifies levels of conformance. The ACR-NEMA standard specified a minimum level of conformance. DICOM explicitly describes how an implementor must structure a Conformance Statement to select specific options.In 1995, with the addition of DICOM capabilities for cardiology imaging supported by the American College of Cardiology, the ACR-NEMA Joint Committee was reorganized as the DICOM Standards Committee, a broad collaboration of stakeholders across all medical imaging specialities.0.2	Principles0.2.1	Global applicability and localizationDICOM is a world-wide standard that can be used in every locale. It provides mechanisms to handle data that support cultural requirements, such as different writing systems, character sets, languages, and structures for addresses and person names. It supports the variety of workflows, processes and policies used for biomedical imaging in different geographic regions, medical specialities and local practices.Localization to meet the requirements of national or local health and workflow policies can be done without deviating from the DICOM standard. Such localization may include specifying code sets (e.g. procedure codes) or profiling data element usage (both specifying locally-allowed values, and making elements that are optional in the DICOM standard mandatory for local use).Localization and profiling can be specified in a number of mechanisms outside the purview of the DICOM standard. One such mechanism is Integration Profiles from the Integrating the Healthcare EnterpriseŒæ(IHE) organization. It is important that Profiling adhere to the concept of non-contradiction. A Profile can add requirements but should not contradict DICOM requirements, as that would make it impossible to comply with both DICOM and the Profile.0.2.2	Continuous maintenanceThe DICOM standard is an evolving standard and it is maintained in accordance with the Procedures of the DICOM Standards Committee. Proposals for enhancements are welcome from all users of the DICOM standard and may be submitted to the Secretariat. Supplements and corrections to the DICOM standard are balloted and approved several times a year. When approved as Final Text, each change becomes official, is published separately, and goes into effect immediately. At intervals, all of the approved Final Text changes are consolidated and published in an updated edition of the DICOM standard. Once changes are consolidated into an updated edition of the DICOM standard, the individual change documents are not maintained; readers are directed to use the consolidated edition of the DICOM standard.A requirement in updating the DICOM standard is to maintain effective compatibility with previous editions.The maintenance process may involve retirement of sections of the DICOM standard.Retirement does not imply that these features cannot be used. However, the DICOM Standards Committee will not maintain the documentation of retired features. The reader is referred to earlier editions of the DICOM standard.The use of the retired features is discouraged for new implementations, in favour of those alternatives remaining in the DICOM standard.0.2.3	Information objects and unique object identificationMany DICOM services involve the exchange of persistent information objects, such as images. An instance of such an information object may be exchanged across many systems and many organizational contexts, and over time. While minor changes may be made to the attributes of an instance to facilitate its handling within a particular organization (e.g. by coercing a Patient ID to the value used in a local context), the semantic content of an instance does not change.Each instance is identified by a globally unique object identifier, which persists with the instance across all exchanges. Changes to the semantic content of an instance are defined to create a new instance, which is assigned a new globally unique object identifier.0.2.4	ConformanceConformance to the DICOM standard is stated in terms of Service-Object PairŒæ(SOP) Classes, which represent Services (such as Storage using network, media, or web) operating on types of Information Objects (such as CT or MR images).SOP Class specifications in the DICOM standard are only changed in a manner that is intended to be forward and backward compatible for all editions of the DICOM standard. Conformance requirements and conformance claims are therefore referenced to the identifier of the SOP Class, and never referenced to an edition of the DICOM standard.Each implementation is required to provide a Conformance Statement, in accordance with a consistent pro forma structure, facilitating comparison of products for interoperability.0.2.5	Consistency of information modelA large number of information objects defined in the DICOM standard follow a common composite information model with information entities representing Patient, Study, Series, Equipment, Frame of Reference, and the specific instance data type. This information model is a simplification of the real world concepts and activities of medical imaging; for acquisition modalities, a Study is approximately equivalent to an ordered procedure, and a Series is approximately equivalent to a performed data acquisition protocol element. In other domains, such as Radiotherapy, the Study and Series are less clearly related to real world entities or activities, but are still required for consistency. This simplified model is sufficient for the pragmatic needs of managing imaging and related data collected in routine practice.New information objects defined in DICOM will typically conform to this existing common information model, allowing reuse of implementations with minimal changes to support the new objects."

However there are security issues that are not covered by current information security, Internet security, network security and ICT security best practices as there are gaps between these domains, as well as a lack of communication between organizations and providers in the Cyberspace. This is because the devices and connected networks that have supported the Cyberspace have multiple owners, each with their own business, operational and regulatory concerns. The different focus placed by each organization and provider in the Cyberspace on relevant security domains where little or no input is taken from another organization or provider has resulted in a fragmented state of security for the Cyberspace.As such, the first area of focus of this International Standard is to address Cyberspace security or Cybersecurity issues which concentrate on bridging the gaps between the different security domains in the Cyberspace.

This collaboration must be in a secure and reliable manner that also protects the privacy of the individuals concerned. Many of these stakeholders can reside in different geographical locations and time zones, and are likely to be governed by different regulatory requirements. Stakeholders include:äóî consumers, which can be various types of organizations or individuals; andäóî providers, which include service providers.Thus, this International Standard also provides a framework foräóî information sharing,äóî coordination, andäóî incident handling.The framework includesäóî key elements of considerations for establishing trust,äóî necessary processes for collaboration and information exchange and sharing, as well asäóî technical requirements for systems integration and interoperability between different stakeholders.Given the scope of this International Standard, the controls provided are necessarily at a high level.

The general use of IDPS continues to expand with a wider range of IDPS products being made available to satisfy an increasing level of organizational demands for advanced intrusion detection capability.In order for an organization to derive the maximum benefits from IDPS, the process of IDPS selection, deployment, and operations should be carefully planned and implemented by properly trained and experienced personnel. In the case where this process is achieved, then IDPS products can assist an organization in obtaining intrusion information and can serve as an important security device within the overall information and communications technology (ICT) infrastructure.This International Standard provides guidelines for effective IDPS selection, deployment, and operation, as well as fundamental knowledge about IDPS. It is also applicable to those organizations that are considering outsourcing their intrusion detection capabilities. Information about outsourcing service level agreements can be found in the IT service management (ITSM) processes based on ISO/IECŒæ20000 Series.This International Standard is intended to be helpful to: a) An organization in satisfying the following requirements of ISO/IECŒæ27001:äóî The organization shall implement procedures and other controls capable of enabling prompt detection of and response to security incidents;äóî The organization shall execute monitoring and review procedures and other controls to properly identify attempted and successful security breaches and incidents.b) An organization in implementing controls that meet the following security objectives of ISO/IECŒæ27002:äóî To detect unauthorized information processing activities;äóî Systems should be monitored and information security events should be recorded. Operator logs and fault logging should be used to ensure information system problems are identified;äóî An organization should comply with all relevant legal requirements applicable to its monitoring and logging activities;äóî System monitoring should be used to check the effectiveness of controls adopted and to verify conformity to an access policy model.An organization should recognize that deploying IDPS is not a sole and/or exhaustive solution to satisfy or meet the above-cited requirements. Furthermore, this International Standard is not intended as criteria for any kind of conformity assessments, e.g., information security management system (ISMS) certification, IDPS services or products certification."

An exploitation of vulnerabilities results in a disruption of the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of the ICT system or related information assets, which may cause a breach of data privacy, interruption of operation of mission critical systems, and so on.Vulnerabilities can be caused by both software or hardware design and programming flaws. Poor administrative processes and a lack of user awareness and education can also be a source of vulnerabilities, as can unforeseen changes in operating environments. Regardless of the cause, an exploitation of such vulnerabilities may result in real threats to mission-critical information systems. Individuals and organizations, including businesses and governments, rely heavily on hardware and software components used in operating systems, applications, networks, and critical national infrastructure. Vulnerabilities in these components increase risk to the information residing on them, thus increasing risks to users and owners of the information. In addition, the lack of awareness about these vulnerabilities also increases risk.Inappropriate disclosure of a vulnerability could not only delay the deployment of the vulnerability resolution but also give attackers hints to exploit it. That is why vulnerability disclosure should be carried out appropriately.Vulnerability disclosure is a process through which vendors and vulnerability finders may work cooperatively in finding solutions that reduce the risks associated with a vulnerability. It encompasses actions such as reporting, coordinating, and publishing information about a vulnerability and its resolution.The goals of vulnerability disclosure include the following:a) ensuring that identified vulnerabilities are addressed;b) minimizing the risk from vulnerabilities;c) providing users with sufficient information to evaluate risks from vulnerabilities to their systems; d) setting expectations to promote positive communication and coordination among involved parties.This International Standard provides guidelines for vendors to be included in their business processes when receiving information about potential vulnerabilities and distributing vulnerability resolution information."

This standard is also intended for use in developing industry- and organization-specific information security management guidelines, taking into consideration their specific information security risk environment(s).Organizations of all types and sizes (including public and private sector, commercial and non-profit) collect, process, store and transmit information in many forms including electronic, physical and verbal (e.g. conversations and presentations).The value of information goes beyond the written words, numbers and images: knowledge, concepts, ideas and brands are examples of intangible forms of information. In an interconnected world, information and related processes, systems, networks and personnel involved in their operation, handling and protection are assets that, like other important business assets, are valuable to an organizationäó»s business and consequently deserve or require protection against various hazards.Assets are subject to both deliberate and accidental threats while the related processes, systems, networks and people have inherent vulnerabilities. Changes to business processes and systems or other external changes (such as new laws and regulations) may create new information security risks. Therefore, given the multitude of ways in which threats could take advantage of vulnerabilities to harm the organization, information security risks are always present. Effective information security reduces these risks by protecting the organization against threats and vulnerabilities, and then reduces impacts to its assets.Information security is achieved by implementing a suitable set of controls, including policies, processes, procedures, organizational structures and software and hardware functions. These controls need to be established, implemented, monitored, reviewed and improved, where necessary, to ensure that the specific security and business objectives of the organization are met. An ISMS such as that specified in ISO/IECŒæ27001[10] takes a holistic, coordinated view of the organizationäó»s information security risks in order to implement a comprehensive suite of information security controls under the overall framework of a coherent management system.Many information systems have not been designed to be secure in the sense of ISO/IECŒæ27001[10] and this standard. The security that can be achieved through technical means is limited and should be supported by appropriate management and procedures. Identifying which controls should be in place requires careful planning and attention to detail. A successful ISMS requires support by all employees in the organization. It can also require participation from shareholders, suppliers or other external parties. Specialist advice from external parties can also be needed.In a more general sense, effective information security also assures management and other stakeholders that the organizationäó»s assets are reasonably safe and protected against harm, thereby acting as a business enabler.0.2	Information security requirementsIt is essential that an organization identifies its security requirements. There are three main sources of security requirements:a) the assessment of risks to the organization, taking into account the organizationäó»s overall business strategy and objectives. Through a risk assessment, threats to assets are identified, vulnerability to and likelihood of occurrence is evaluated and potential impact is estimated;b) the legal, statutory, regulatory and contractual requirements that an organization, its trading partners, contractors and service providers have to satisfy, and their socio-cultural environment;c) the set of principles, objectives and business requirements for information handling, processing, storing, communicating and archiving that an organization has developed to support its operations.Resources employed in implementing controls need to be balanced against the business harm likely to result from security issues in the absence of those controls. The results of a risk assessment will help guide and determine the appropriate management action and priorities for managing information security risks and for implementing controls selected to protect against these risks.ISO/IECŒæ27005[11] provides information security risk management guidance, including advice on risk assessment, risk treatment, risk acceptance, risk communication, risk monitoring and risk review.0.3	Selecting controlsControls can be selected from this standard or from other control sets, or new controls can be designed to meet specific needs as appropriate.The selection of controls is dependent upon organizational decisions based on the criteria for risk acceptance, risk treatment options and the general risk management approach applied to the organization, and should also be subject to all relevant national and international legislation and regulations. Control selection also depends on the manner in which controls interact to provide defence in depth.Some of the controls in this standard can be considered as guiding principles for information security management and applicable for most organizations. The controls are explained in more detail below along with implementation guidance. More information about selecting controls and other risk treatment options can be found in ISO/IECŒæ27005.[11]0.4	Developing your own guidelinesThis International Standard may be regarded as a starting point for developing organization-specific guidelines. Not all of the controls and guidance in this code of practice may be applicable. Furthermore, additional controls and guidelines not included in this standard may be required. When documents are developed containing additional guidelines or controls, it may be useful to include cross-references to clauses in this standard where applicable to facilitate compliance checking by auditors and business partners.0.5	Lifecycle considerationsInformation has a natural lifecycle, from creation and origination through storage, processing, use and transmission to its eventual destruction or decay. The value of, and risks to, assets may vary during their lifetime (e.g.Œæunauthorized disclosure or theft of a companyäó»s financial accounts is far less significant after they have been formally published) but information security remains important to some extent at all stages.Information systems have lifecycles within which they are conceived, specified, designed, developed, tested, implemented, used, maintained and eventually retired from service and disposed of. Information security should be taken into account at every stage. New system developments and changes to existing systems present opportunities for organizations to update and improve security controls, taking actual incidents and current and projected information security risks into account.0.6	Related standardsWhile this standard offers guidance on a broad range of information security controls that are commonly applied in many different organizations, the remaining standards in the ISO/IECŒæ27000 family provide complementary advice or requirements on other aspects of the overall process of managing information security.Refer to ISO/IECŒæ27000 for a general introduction to both ISMSs and the family of standards. ISO/IECŒæ27000 provides a glossary, formally defining most of the terms used throughout the ISO/IECŒæ27000 family of standards, and describes the scope and objectives for each member of the family."

A new technology is involved, which can provide opportunities for integration of traditional system components (including crew tasks) and more complex behaviour. This allows increases in efficiency and safety through improved monitoring, better situational awareness on the bridge, etc. However, PES are complex products and, like all products, they can contain defects. These defects cannot be seen. Software does not respond to traditional engineering methods for the testing of soundness. The combination of complexity, replacement of a combination of mechanical and crew functions with computer hardware and software, and industry practice in developing and maintaining marine PES leads to a wide range of potential defects which cannot be guarded against by prescriptive standards.The use of a PES in the management, monitoring or control of a ship may have several effects:äóî potential to enhance the ability and efficiency of the crew;äóî changes in the organization of work through the automation of lower-level tasks;äóî integration of systems through use of several systems by one seafarer;äóî shift in the role of the crew towards the management of many linked, complex PES;äóî shift of the crew's perception of the ship to that presented by the interfaces of the PES;äóî layers of embedded and/or application software interposed between the crew and the ship;äóî physical interconnection of ship systems through the use of computer networks.The overall effect of the use of PES is that the ship becomes one total system of inter-linked PES and crew which work together to fulfil the operator's business goals for the ship. In order for this total system to be dependable, both the design of the PES and the management of its use have to support the safe and effective performance of the crew as a critical component of the total system. Such a human-centred approach has to be based on a thorough knowledge of the particular skills, working environment and tasks of the crew using the PES. The total system concept is described further in A.2.In the traditional approach to maritime safety, ship systems are built to and operated against precise, prescriptive standards. These standards were developed in response to feedback about incidents or risky behaviour of previous ship systems. This approach is appropriate for relatively simple systems in a time of slow technical innovation. However, suppliers and operators nowadays want to innovate with complex, new solutions. In addition, the base technologies for PES are evolving very quickly. The assurance of dependability in this case cannot rely on knowledge of previous systems. The solution is for the developer and operator to assess the risks from and to the particular ship, its systems, crew and its operating philosophy, and to address these specific risks in the design and operation of the PES. Components of the system can then either be re-designed or operated in such a way as to minimize these risks. The quality of construction, operation and maintenance of the system to be sure of the achievement of a required level of dependability of the PES is also defined.This International Standard is based on best practice in PES development as stated in existing marine, electrical and electronic, IT, ergonomics and safety standards. It is not intended to replace any of these standards. It presents a synoptic view of the requirements of these standards as a framework of principles for the development of dependable PES."

The Body of Knowledge is subdivided into fifteen software engineering Knowledge Areas (KA) providing an outline of topics. The descriptions in the KAs are designed to discriminate among the various important concepts, permitting readers to find their way quickly to subjects of interest. Upon finding a subject, readers are referred to key papers or books selected because they succinctly present the knowledge.Publication of the 2004 version of this Guide to the Software Engineering Body of Knowledge (SWEBOK 2004)äóîadopted as ISO/IECŒæTRŒæ19759:2005äóîwas a major milestone in establishing software engineering as a recognized engineering discipline. The goal in developing this update to SWEBOK is to improve the currency, readability, consistency, and usability of the Guide. All knowledge areas (KAs) have been updated to reflect changes in software engineering since publication of SWEBOK 2004. Four new foundation KAs and a Software Engineering Professional Practices KA have been added. The Software Engineering Tools and Methods KA has been revised as Software Engineering Models and Methods. Software engineering tools is now a topic in each of the KAs. Three appendices provide the specifications for the KA description, an annotated set of relevant standards for each KA, and a listing of the references cited in the Guide.An emphasis on engineering practice leads the Guide toward a strong relationship with the normative literature. Most of the computer science, information technology and software engineering literature provides information useful to software engineers, but a relatively small portion is normative. A normative document prescribes what an engineer should do in a specified situation rather than providing information that might be helpful. The normative literature is validated by consensus formed among practitioners and is concentrated in standards and related documents. From the beginning, the SWEBOK project was conceived as having a strong relationship to the normative literature of software engineering. The two major standards bodies for software engineering (IEEE Computer Society Software and Systems Engineering Standards Committee and ISO/IEC JTC1/SC7) cooperated in the project.The Guide is oriented toward a variety of audiences, all over the world. It aims to serve public and private organizations in need of a consistent view of software engineering for defining education and training requirements, classifying jobs, developing performance evaluation policies or specifying software development tasks. It also addresses practicing, or managing, software engineers and the officials responsible for making public policy regarding licensing and professional guidelines. In addition, professional societies and educators defining the certification rules, accreditation policies for university curricula, and guidelines for professional practice will benefit from the SWEBOK Guide, as well as the students learning the software engineering profession and educators and trainers engaged in defining curricula and course content."

The specifications for general, radiological, environmental, electromagnetic, and mechanical performance are given, and the corresponding testing methods are described. The documentation to be provided by the manufacturer is listed as part of the requirements. A number of informative annexes that provide useful information and guidance in implementing this standard are also contained in this standard.","This standard describes minimum performance requirements and test methods for evaluating the performance of alarming personal radiation detectors (PRDs) for homeland security applications. PRDs are pocket-sized battery-powered alarming electronic instruments that are worn on the body and used to detect photon-emitting, and optionally neutron-emitting, radioactive materials. PRDs have user-readable displays related to the intensity of radiation, but they are distinct from, and typically more sensitive than, electronic personal dosimeters, which are designed to measure the dose equivalent to workers occupationally exposed to radiation. The performance criteria contained in this standard are meant to provide the means for verifying the capability of the PRDs to reliably detect changes above background levels of ionizing radiation fields and alert the user to these changes. This standard also specifies the requirements and test methods for environmental, electromagnetic, and mechanical conditions that may affect the ability of the PRDs to function properly. This standard does not apply to spectroscopic PRDs that have the ability to identity radionuclides.

These limits and levels are representative of current practice and user needs. Emission limits are specified by national and international standards bodies. Emission limits for the most part are regulated and hence controlled, which is the case in the U.S. and Canada. Such regulatory limits take precedence, even if the limits are different from those considered in this document. For product immunity, while in some parts of the world this is regulated, for the U.S. and Canada, it is not regulated except for some types of safety equipment. In this way, adequate immunity is more a quality aspect of the product because it does not operate in its intended RF environment, the user would deem it of poor design and quality. The immunity test levels described in this document are representative of common levels applied internationally. However, severe environments (in which levels of electromagnetic disturbance are high) require the consideration of applying higher test levels. This consideration is described in this recommended practice. Finally, it should be noted that the entire recommended practice does not contain normative requirements, as such practices remain optional.","This recommended practice presents a rationale for developing emission limits and immunity test levels and recommends that these facets are representative of current practice and user needs. Emission limits generally are written by national and international standards bodies. Emission limits for the most part are specified by regulators, which is the case in the U.S. and Canada. Such regulatory limits take precedence, even if the limits are different from those considered in this document.

There might also be a need to have different (higher) immunity test levels than what is typically required if the product will be used in severe electromagnetic environments. As the use of electronics is constantly changing (e.g., the Smart Grid [B10]1), the test methods, immunity test levels, and emission limits likewise need to be periodically reviewed to assure that EMC is maintained. In fact, these EMC considerations might have to be tailored for specific designs and go beyond regulatory requirements to ensure proper product operation at the user location, which is exposed to a myriad of RF environments and where it is likely that there are other electronic products that might suffer interference from RF generated by the product. The emissions and immunity measurement technique used can have an impact on the accuracy, repeatability, and reproducibility of the test results. Emissions from products should be controlled to protect radio services by not causing interference, and at the same time, products should have sufficient immunity to be able to operate as intended in the RF environments expected in locations where the products are intended to be used.",ANSI C63.12-2015 (Revision of ANSI C63.12-1999) - Redline,

Such networks are not adequately addressed by existing standards, especially for those networks that are ac-coupled, differential, or both.

IEEE Std 1149.1 structures and methods are intended to test static (dc-coupled), single-ended networks. They are unable to test dynamic (ac-coupled) digital networks, since ac coupling blocks static signals. Differential networks are also inadequately tested by IEEE Std 1149.1, which requires either the insertion of boundary cells between the differential driver or receiver and the chip pads (this often creates an unacceptable performance degradation), or insertion of single boundary cells before the differential driver and after the differential receiver (this reduces controllability and observability to the point that many board assembly defects cannot be detected). IEEE Std 1149.4 structures and methods are intended for testing analog networks, and in most cases are not able to test these newer digital networks as well. Specifically, IEEE Std 1149.4 provides the opportunity to inject dynamic (time-varying) or analog signals for test, but these structures intended for analog testing are often too intrusive (too high an impact on performance and pin count) for high speed chip designs, and require additional resources and test application time not otherwise required for testing digital circuits.

,,ANSI C63.16-2016 (Revision of ANSI C63.16-1993),http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7465684,"Expanded explanations, best practices, and guidance for avoiding the pitfalls associated with electrostatic discharge (ESD) testing to IEC and other international ESD standards are provided and should be considered a supplement to these standards, rather than a replacement. Unique ESD test procedures related to connecting charged peripherals to equipment in use are also included. ** Downloads file posted at http://standards.ieee.org/downloads/C63/C63.16/.","This guide provides electrostatic discharge (ESD) test considerations that a manufacturer should use in assessing the expected ESD effects on products in a wide range of environments and customer use. The focus is well beyond that used to simply show that a product complies with a local, regional, or international standard or regulation. The following are included: charged peripheral testing, connector pin testing, and details on the use of ESD simulators. Finally, suggestions for assuring the safety of those who apply the ESD discharge are provided. The annexes include information on test method selection and more background on air and contact discharge for those who want to further understand the differences in these methods. This guide is not applicable to manufacturing, service, or maintenance of equipment. Personnel who perform these activities should be trained to avoid ESD effects or damage to the equipment. In summary, this guide has test techniques beyond those that are commonly used (e.g., IEC 61000-4-2), and hence it can be a significant tool for increasing the immunity of products to ESD events.","This guide is intended for use by product manufacturers internal or third-party electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) test laboratories that perform ESD immunity tests on products. It is intended to supplement and complement test methods commonly used for demonstrating compliance with ESD requirements such as IEC 61000-4-2. For completeness, the test methods and parameters described herein reference that ESD standard. The complementary test methods provided herein extend the application of ESD testing and can serve as a resource in the development of ESD test plans. This extension of testing requires more time than that needed to perform tests to international ESD standards such as IEC 61000-4-2. The payoff is that this additional ESD investigation is expected to significantly reduce the number of customer complaints by revealing responses that are not found with the usual ESD testing prescribed in existing international standards. This guide also recommends test criteria for applying ESD events and for evaluating equipment exposure and responses to ESD. The actual test levels and acceptable performance depend on criteria set by the equipment manufacturer, which might be based on customer ESD performance experience with the product and the risk of failure in a wide variety of product use environments in which ESD events have different probabilities of occurrence.",ANSI C63.16-2016 (Revision of ANSI C63.16-1993),

The per-unit system thereby makes possible an easy comparison between different machines, essentially independent of size, without the use of conversion factors, and facilitates the identification of gross calculation errors. The proper selection of base values is fundamental to the usefulness of a per-unit system. Although per-unit quantities have been used for many years by designers of rotating machinery, the base quantities were not standardized, and it was necessary to define them in each publication. A working group of the Rotating Machinery Committee was created to propose a set of standard definitions. In 1961, a proposed standard (AIEE No. 86) was published for trial use. A critical review of that proposed standard has resulted in this present standard.","Since rotating machines convert mechanical energy to electrical energy, or electrical energy to mechanical energy, base values for each kind of energy appear desirable. However, the relationships between these energies involve power factor and efficiency. These are not fundamental quantities, and vary considerably between different designs. While generator designers consider base power to be output power, synchronous-motor designers consider base power to be input power. Other motor designers consider it to be output power. The consensus of large synchronous motor designers favors using the rated apparent input power as the base even though it is necessary to know power factor and efficiency. This permits the use of the same design equations for both synchronous generators and synchronous motors. For induction motors, however, a more practical approach is to use the rated output power as a base, thereby eliminating assumptions of power factor and efficiency. This is particularly desirable when dealing with small machines or machines with many poles, where power factor and efficiency are not known and accurate estimates are difficult to make",,IEEE Std 86-1975 (Revision of IEEE Std 86-1961),

IEEE Std 1149.1 structures and methods are intended to test static (dc-coupled), single-ended networks. They are unable to test dynamic (ac-coupled) digital networks, since ac coupling blocks static signals. Differential networks are also inadequately tested by IEEE Std 1149.1, which requires either the insertion of boundary cells between the differential driver or receiver and the chip pads (this often creates an unacceptable performance degradation), or insertion of single boundary cells before the differential driver and after the differential receiver (this reduces controllability and observability to the point that many board assembly defects cannot be detected). IEEE Std 1149.4 structures and methods are intended for testing analog networks, and in most cases are not able to test these newer digital networks as well. Specifically, IEEE Std 1149.4 provides the opportunity to inject dynamic (time-varying) or analog signals for test, but these structures intended for analog testing are often too intrusive (too high an impact on performance and pin count) for high speed chip designs, and require additional resources and test application time not otherwise required for testing digital circuits.

,,ANSI/IEEE Std 455-1976,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7422618,"Telephone companies and equipment manufacturers have generally agreed on a definition for longitudinal balance for many years. This agreement extends also to the basic approach followed when measuring balance. Testing a device for balance involves the application of a longitudinal voltage. Then any resulting metallic voltage is measured, and the ratio of the two voltages is used to develop a balance number.Unfortunately, agreement has ended at about this point. A number of different test circuits are used by different segments of the telephone industry. Although all of the existing test circuits have some merits supporting their use, the mere existence of varied circuits leads to differences in test results.In addition to differences related to the test set, test conditions and procedures can also affect the result. When an item of equipment is to be tested, there is often a test set or procedure,or both, capable of giving any desired result.Agreement on one way of testing for longitudinal balance has been sought. This standard represents such agreement. It defines the basic requirements of a standard test circuit. Reasonable tolerances are included so that a test-set designer will find considerable latitude to make the set his own way. Besides defining the requirements for a test circuit, this standard includes test conditions and procedures that must be established and followed. As a result, all test sets designed and used in accordance with the standard will produce the same balance number for a given test specimen. Similarly, comparing balance numbers for different devices will become more meaningful when all come from tests meeting the standard.","This standard is based on a resistive test circuit, although pure resistance is not essential.

The quantity for specifying the recorded signal is the short-circuit magnetic flux, sometimes simply shortened to flux. Several possible methods exist for measuring tape flux, but the measurement given here involves only the use of a calibrated ring-core head which is described in the reference of the standard. Note that the present standard measurement is only for ""medium wavelengths"". A further standard method for measuring short-circuit flux at long wavelengths and at short wavelengths - that is, the ""frequency response"" of the flux on a magnetic record - is under consideration. The technique utilizing a calibrated ring-core head to measure directly the flux at medium wavelengths is superior to magnetometer methods and to ""single turn head"" methods which have been used in the past because the head is easily manufactured using highly perfected commercial methods. The transducer (head) is commercially available to any laboratory at a reasonable cost; it is easily used, and requires no specialized auxiliary equipment. A further advantage of this method over magnetometer methods is the elimination of the errors inherent in making the ""transfer"" recording which is necessary for a magnetometer measurement. This standard represents the joint efforts of the Recording and Reproducing Standards Subcommittee of the Standards Committee of IEEE Group on Audio and Electroacoustics and the Sound Engineering Committee of the Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers.

In carrying out the test procedures described herein, the following general precautions are recommended: Maximum diode voltage, current, radiation flux ratings, device ambient temperature and environment, and other operational limits specified by the detector manufacturer should not be exceeded, or permanent changes of the detector characteristics may result. All measurements shall be performed with the semiconductor material in total darkness. The values of the parameters measured should be reproducible, within the stated precision of the measurement, after the performance of any one or all of the tests performed. The ripple, hum, stability, etc, of the detector bias supply shall not substantially influence the resolution or other detector parameter measurements. Since germanium detectors exist in a variety of sizes and configurations and operate in a vacuum environment at low temperatures (usually near 77 K) , the detector assembly is treated as a "" blackbox "" and all geometrical measurements are referred to the outer encapsulating container.

This method of charging allows significantly more current to be drawn by the vehicle versus lower rated alternating-current (ac) systems. A combination of vehicles that can accept high-current dc charge and the dc supply equipment that provides it has led to the use of terminology such as fast charging, fast charger, dc charger, quick charger, etc. DC charging and ac charging vary by the location at which ac current is converted to dc current. For typical dc charging, the current is converted at the off-board charger, which is separate from the vehicle. For ac charging, the current is converted inside the vehicle, by means of an on-board charger. The location of the ac to dc conversion equipment, or converter, shapes the complexity of the equipment design. Regarding ac charging, as previously mentioned, the conversion is on boardthe vehicle. This allows the original equipment maker (OEM) designed systems to control the charging operation in its entirety. The on-board charger (converter) and battery controller solutionis under direct control of the vehicle manufacturer. For dc charging, an entirely new challenge exists for OEMs. The dc charger is now external to the vehicle and requires the vehicle engineers to control an external power device. For the reason of necessary interoperability, standards such as IEEE Std 2030.1.1 are provided to assist developers.",This standard specifies the design interface of electric vehicles and direct current (dc) quick chargers that promote rapid charging of battery electric vehicles.,,IEEE Std 2030.1.1-2015,

These limits and levels are representative of current practice and user needs. Emission limits are specified by national and international standards bodies. Emission limits for the most part are regulated and hence controlled, which is the case in the U.S. and Canada. Such regulatory limits take precedence, even if the limits are different from those considered in this document. For product immunity, while in some parts of the world this is regulated, for the U.S. and Canada, it is not regulated except for some types of safety equipment. In this way, adequate immunity is more a quality aspect of the product because it does not operate in its intended RF environment, the user would deem it of poor design and quality. The immunity test levels described in this document are representative of common levels applied internationally. However, severe environments (in which levels of electromagnetic disturbance are high) require the consideration of applying higher test levels. This consideration is described in this recommended practice. Finally, it should be noted that the entire recommended practice does not contain normative requirements, as such practices remain optional.","This recommended practice presents a rationale for developing emission limits and immunity test levels and recommends that these facets are representative of current practice and user needs. Emission limits generally are written by national and international standards bodies. Emission limits for the most part are specified by regulators, which is the case in the U.S. and Canada. Such regulatory limits take precedence, even if the limits are different from those considered in this document. In the U.S. and Canada, productimmunity is not regulated except for some safety equipment. In this way, adequate immunity is more a quality aspect of the product as if it does not operate in its intended RF environment, the user would deem it of poor quality. It should be noted that the entire document does not impose normative requirements, but recommends options.","The main purpose of this recommended practice is to aid manufacturers who might need to modify the emissions their products generate (as long as regulatory limits are met) to meet for example intra-system needs for their products. There might also be a need to have different (higher) immunity test levels than what is typically required if the product will be used in severe electromagnetic environments. As the use of electronics is constantly changing (e.g., the Smart Grid [B10]1), the test methods, immunity test levels, and emission limits likewise need to be periodically reviewed to assure that EMC is maintained. In fact, these EMC considerations might have to be tailored for specific designs and go beyond regulatory requirements to ensure proper product operation at the user location, which is exposed to a myriad of RF environments and where it is likely that there are other electronic products that might suffer interference from RF generated by the product. The emissions and immunity measurement technique used can have an impact on the accuracy, repeatability, and reproducibility of the test results. Emissions from products should be controlled to protect radio services by not causing interference, and at the same time, products should have sufficient immunity to be able to operate as intended in the RF environments expected in locations where the products are intended to be used.",ANSI C63.12-2015 (Revision of ANSI C63.12-1999),

American National Standard C37.20-1969 specifies the temperature rise above a standard ambient temperature of 40C. This is satisfactory for indoor applications where the temperature rise is due entirely to heat release. However, when the gear is located outdoors, several additional factors require consideration. The effect of sun, wind, ventilation, ambient temperature, etc., on internal temperatures will be considered in this Guide. The magnitude of these factors will vary geographically and from season to season. The time relationship of maximum circuit-breaker loads with respect to maximum ambient temperature is important. It is not practical to design switchgear on the basis that all adverse factors reach their maxima coincident with maximum loads. If this does not occur, full current ratings may be realized. Recommendations will be made to point out the cumulative effect of these various influences.",IEEE Std No 144-1971 (ANSI C37.24-1971),

These are now incorporated into the structures of the IEEE Group on Antennas and Propagation and the IEEE Group on Microwave Theory and Techniques, respectively. In general, the definitions assume that the antenna is not located in a medium such as a plasma, salt water, or the earth. In such cases, careful evaluation may be necessary to determine whether the term is applicable and how it can be properly employed. For terms that are quantitative it is understood that frequency must be specified. Those terms in which phase or polarization is a significant part of the definition imply a coherent source of power. Whenever a term is commonly used in other fields but has specialized significance in the field of antennas, this is noted in the title.","In 1948, two complementary Standards on antennas were published by the IRE; these were Definitions of Terms and Methods of Testing. Both were the work of the Technical Committee on Antennas. Subsequently, this committee was renamed the Antennas and Waveguides Committee, and three Standards dealing with waveguides were published during the period from 1953 to 1959. The attention of the committee then returned to antennas, and in 1965 Test Procedure for Antennas (IEEE No. 149) was published. This was a revision of the 1948 Methods of Testing; it also contained a short list of new and revised definitions of terms as well as a discussion of their significance.

In 1976, the Insulated Conductors Committee, in cooperation with the Insulated Cables Engineering Association (ICEA) and the National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA), published supplemental ampacity tables to provide ampacity ratings for single conductor cables with shield losses due to circulating currents. That publication was needed due to the tremendous increase in the use of single conductor extruded dielectric cables with multiple point bonding and grounding.As time passed, new cable designs were developed with synthetic insulation, different shielding designs and higher operating voltages and temperatures. Moreover, new technology and equipment was developed for measuring the thermal properties of soil. These developments with heat transfer in soils provided a different ,lnderstanding and approach for rating cables based on maximum cable/earth interface temperature.

ISO/IEC 15288:2008 (IEEE Std 15288-2008), and ISO/IEC 12207:2008 (IEEE Std 12207-2008)establish a common framework for software life-cycle processes and in passing identify or require a number of documentation items. Its process reference model does not represent a particular process implementation approach, nor does it prescribe a system/software life-cycle model, methodology, or technique. ISO/IEC 12207:2008 (IEEE Std 12207-2008) does not always specify when software information items are to be prepared, nor does it identify information item contents. ISO/IEC 20000-1:2011 (IEEE Std 20000-1-2013) establishes comprehensive requirements for documents and records, with some specific requirements. ISO/IEC 20000-2:2012 (IEEE Std 20000-2-2013), Information technology -- Service management -- Part 2: Guidance on the application of service management systems provides guidance on the use of Part 1.The generic document types (which may be referred to as information item types) are to be used to identify theinformation necessary to support the ISO/IEC 15288:2008 (IEEE Std 15288-2008) agreement, enterprise, project, and technical processes; the ISO/IEC 12207:2008 (IEEE Std 12207-2008) primary, supporting, and organizational life-cycle processes; or the ISO/IEC 20000-1:2011 (IEEE Std 20000-1-2013) service management system (SMS), service delivery, relationship, resolution, and control processes. For each life-cycle process or service, it would be possible to prepare a policy, plan, procedures, and reports, as well as numerous records, requests, descriptions and specifications. Such an elaboration of the documentation schema would be more rigorous than specified by ISO/IEC 15288:2008 (IEEE Std 15288-2008) or ISO/IEC 12207:2008 (IEEE Std 12207-2008). As ISO/IEC 15288:2008 (IEEE Std 15288-2008) points out (1.4), This International Standard does not detail the life-cycle processes in terms of methods or procedures required to meet the requirements and outcomes of a process. Thus, information items may be combined or subdivided as needed for project or organizational purposes, as further defined in Clause 2, applicability, and Clause 3, Conformance.This International Standard does not establish a service management system. The scope of this International Standard does not include the following: a) the format or content of recommended input data or input information items, except for the content of those input items that are also output information items; b) instructions on combining or subdividing information items and information item contents of a similar nature; c) guidance on selecting an appropriate presentation format, delivery media, and maintenance technology for system and software life-cycle data, records, information items, or documentation, such as electronic publishing systems, content management systems, or data repositories.NOTE 2 ISO/IEC 26514:2008, Systems and software engineering -- Requirements for designers and developers of user documentation, provides guidance on formats for software user documentation.

Their guidance includes descriptions of a set of information items (documents) that an assessor may encounter. The information items in their guidance may be produced by combinations and subdivisions of the required information items in this International Standard.","The purpose of this International Standard is to provide requirements for users of ISO/IEC 12207:2008 (IEEE Std 12207-2008), ISO/IEC 15288:2008 (IEEE Std 15288-2008) and ISO/IEC 20000-1:2011 (IEEE Std 20000-1-2013) for identifying and planning the specific information items (information products) to be developed and revised during systems and software life cycles and service management processes. This International Standard is intended for use as follows. a) To address the technical information needed by those involved in ISO/IEC 15288:2008 (IEEE Std 15288-2008) and ISO/IEC 12207:2008 (IEEE Std 12207-2008) processes.b) To specify information in an agreement process as described in ISO/IEC 15288:2008 (IEEE Std 15288-2008) or a two-party situation as described in ISO/IEC 12207:2008 (IEEE Std 12207-2008), ISO/IEC 20000-1:2011 (IEEE Std 20000-1-2013) and ISO/IEC 20000-2:2012 (IEEE Std 20000-2-2013).

Content objects that are unique and are maintained as independent database objects are efficient to review, approve, and update; may be combined to produce multiple deliverables; and are cost-effective to translate. The standard defines the characteristics of an effective and efficient process through which content is gathered, managed, and published, including the requirements of a system that is supported by an electronic database. Such a database should support documents or topics and content units that may be assembled to produce complete documents for print, electronic output, or content collections published through electronic media. This database is defined as a component content management system (CCMS), as distinct from a document management system. The objective of component content management is to create content objects once and use them through linking mechanisms in multiple output formats including but not limited to documents. Systems conforming to this standard can fulfill business needs for content development and management, especially the need for a single source of authoritative information. The standard includes business case considerations for acquisition of a content management system. This International Standard is independent of the software tools and markup languages that may be used to manage documentation content, and applies to both printed documentation and on-screen documentation.","This standard states requirements for efficient development and management of content produced throughout the life-cycle of a system and software product; for the provision of user documentation for systems and software; for the management of IT services. This standard is independent of the tools, protocols, and systems used for content management. It does not address configuration management of software assets. The content to be managed with this standard includes user information such as topic collections, manuals, guides, embedded user assistance, style guides, videos and other media, and other content that supports the effective use of a system or software product; product life cycle information such as design documents, use cases, personas, project management plans, feature requests, models, scripts, testing plans, test scripts, defect reports; service management items such as service-level agreements, records, policies, procedures, and other documents. The purpose of this standard is to define a process for content management and the requirements of a component content management system through which content is gathered, managed, and published, including the requirements of a system that is supported by an electronic database. Such a database should support documents or topics and content units that may be assembled to produce complete documents for print, electronic output, or content collections published through electronic media.

The objective of component content management is to create content objects once and use them through linking mechanisms in multiple output formats, including but not limited to documents. The intended users of this International Standard are managers and developers of information (technical documentation) and acquirers and suppliers of content management systems. Any organization that develops content, regardless of size, can benefit from maintaining an effective content management solution and following best practices for the development and management of technical content.

The key-style language supports data/information modeling and is downward compatible with the US government's 1993 standard, FIPS PUB 184. The identity-style language is based on the object model with declarative rules and constraints. IDEF1X97 identity style includes constructs for the distinct but related components of object abstraction: interface, requests, and realization; utilizes graphics to state the interface; and defines a declarative, directly executable Rule and Constraint Language for requests and realizations. IDEF1X97 conceptual modeling supports implementation by relational databases, extended relational databases, object databases, and object programming languages. IDEF1X97 is formally defined in terms of first order logic. A procedure is given whereby any valid IDEF1X97 model can be transformed into an equivalent theory in first order logic. That procedure is then applied to a meta model of IDEF1X97 to define the valid set of IDEF1X97 models.","The semantics and syntax of IDEF1X, a language used to represent a conceptual schema, are described. Two styles of IDEF1X model are described. 1. The key style is used to produce information models that represent the structure and semantics of data within an enterprise and is backward-compatible with the US government's Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) PUB 184, Integration Definition for Information Modeling (IDEF1X). 2. The identity style is used to produce object models that represent the knowledge, behaviour, and rules of the concepts within an enterprise. It can be used as a growth path for key-style models. The identity style can, with suitable automation support, be used to develop a model that is an executable prototype of the target object-oriented system..","This purpose of this standard is to describe the IDEF1X language in an unambiguous manner and thereby meet two important needs. First, those who develop and use IDEF1X models need a common understanding of the modeling constructs and rules. A precise definition of the meaning of the language components allows a model developed by one individual or group to be understood by another. Second, IDEF1X users must be supported in practice by automated tools that record and validate the models. Tool developers need a precise definition of the language so that their products assist users in applying the language correctly and allow exchange of models, at the semantic level, with other tools.The purpose of IDEF1X as a modeling technique is the same as that of all modeling techniques employed in system analysis and development efforts, that is, to plan, build, or use systems and information systems in particular, it helps to understand the meaning of the concepts involved. Modeling provides a language for meanings and is sometimes referred to as closing the semantic gap between the concepts of the enterprise and the capabilities of the computer systems.

An appendix B was added covering the Item Designation system of IEC Publication 113-2. Supplement A of 1970 was incorporated into the text, along with minor clarifications and updating of references. Significant changes are marked by vertical black bars in the margin, adjacent to the changed text. The 1968 revision and its 1970 Supplement coordinated the title with the terms used in related standards, added the class letter U, identified names approved in the Federal Item Identification Guide (H6-1), and transferred the class letter list to IEEE Std 315 (ANSI Y32.2). The original issue of this standard was prepared by Subcommittee 16 on Reference Designations, appointed by Sectional Committee Y32 on Graphic Symbols and Designations for the purpose of preparing standard reference designations in the field of electrical and electronic equipment. Early work on reference designations, of the type herein standardized as the Unit Numbering Method, was done by the Symbols Committee of the Institute of Radio Engineers and was published in 1949 as Standards on Designations for Electrical, Electronic and Mechanical Parts and their Symbols, 49 IRE 21.SI. In 1951 the U.S. Department of Defense issued MIL-STD-16 which closely resembled the IRE Standard and acknowledged the pioneering work of the IRE Symbols Committee in this field. In order to minimize confusion, intensive and successful efforts have since been made to coordinate the two standards throughout their subsequent revisions. The work on this standard was greatly facilitated by the constant participation of representatives of the Department of Defense and the IEEE Symbols Committee. As in MIL-SfD-16C, the original Block Numbering Method of assigning reference designations has been deleted in favor of the more flexible and universally applicable Unit Numbering Method, which is retained, with minor modifications, in Section 4 of this standard. The explanation of the Block Numbering Method appearing as Appendix A does not form a part of this standard, but is retained for reference in connection with existing equipment on which it was used. The subcommittee was assigned the task of standardizing means for physically locating, through a form of reference designation, the parts and divisions of an equipment. The Location Numbering Method in Section 5 and the Location Coding Method in Section 6 of this standard are based on existing industry practices which have been successfully used to facilitate manufacture and service of complex apparatus by providing such locating means. They are especially useful in designs making multiple use of identical or closely similar parts of subassemblies.","This standard covers the formation and application of reference designations for electrical and electronics parts and equipment.The reference designations of this standard are intended for uniquely identifying and locating discrete items on diagrams and in a set, and for correlating items in a set, graphic symbols on diagrams, and items in parts lists, circuit descriptions, and instructions.This standard includes three methods for forming and applying reference designations: the unit number method, the location numbering method, and the location coding method. A complete reference designation may incorporate reference designations formed by the use of any of these methods at any level from basic parts to complete units.The unit numbering method has a long history of satisfactory use in all types of electrical and electronics equipment. The location numbering method and location coding method have been developed to permit rapid physical location of items in large, complicated equipments featuring multiple use of many identical, or closely similar, items.

The following is a partial list of issues that were dropped from the scope of this initial project:-- Levels: A key aspect of a digital test program is the ability to establish voltage and current parameters (levels) for signals under test. Level handling is not explicitly defined in the current standard, as this information is both compact (not presenting a transportation issue) and commonly established independently of digital test data, requiring different support mechanisms outside the current scope of this standard. Termination values may affect levels.-- Diagnostic/fault-tracing information: The goal of this standard is to optimally present data that needs to be moved onto ATE. While diagnostic data, fault identification data, and macro/design element correspondence data can fall into this category (and is often fairly large), this standard is also focused on integrated circuit and assemblies test, and most debug/failure analysis occurs separately from the ATE for these structures. Note that return of failure information (for off-ATE analysis) is also not part of the standard as currently defined.-- Datalogging mechanisms, formatting, and control usually are not defined as part of this currentstandard.-- Parametric tests are not defined as an integral part of this standard, except for optional pattern labels that identify potential locations for parametric tests, such as IDDQ tests or alternating current (AC) timing tests.-- Program flow: Test sequencing and ordering are not defined as part of the current standard except as necessary to define collections of digital patterns meant to execute as a unit.-- Binning constructs are not part of the current standard.-- Analog or mixed-signal test: While this is an area of concern for many participants, at this pointtransfer of analog test data does not contribute to the same transportation issue seen with digital data.-- Algorithmic pattern constructs (such as sequences commonly used for memory test) are not currentlydefined as part of the standard.-- Parallel test/multisite test constructs are not an integral part of the current environment.-- User input and user control/options are not part of the current standard.-- Characterization tools, such as shmoo plots, are not defined as part of the current standard.","This standard addresses a need in the integrated circuit (IC)1 test industry to define a standard mechanism for transferring the large volumes of digital test data from the generation environment through to test. The environment today contains unique output formats of existing CAE tools, individual test environments of IC manufacturers, and proprietary IC ATE input interfaces. As each of these three arenas solves individual problems, together they have created a morass of interfaces, translators, and software environments that provideno opportunity to leverage common goals and result in much wasted efforts re-engineering solutions. Asdevice density increases, the magnitude of test data threatens to shift the test bottleneck from the generationprocess to the processes necessary solely to maintain and transport this data. These two factors threaten toeliminate any productive work performed in this area unless a viable standard is defined.With a common standard for CAE and IC ATE environments, the generation, movement, and processing ofthis test data is greatly facilitated. This standard also allows for immediate access to test equipment supportingthis standard, which benefits both ATE and IC vendors reviewing this equipment.This standard also serves as a catalyst for the development of a set of standard third party interface tools toboth test and design aspects of IC device generation.",IEC 62525:2007 (E),

This mechanism constitutes a hardware architecture and leverages the core test language (CTL) to facilitate communication between core designers and core integrators.,"IEEE Std 1500 has developed a standard design-for-testability method for integrated circuits (ICs) containing embedded nonmergeable cores. This method is independent of the underlying functionality of the IC or its individual embedded cores. The method creates the necessary requirements for the test of such ICs, while allowing for ease of interoperability of cores that may have originated from different sources.","The aim of IEEE Std 1500 is to provide a consistent scalable solution to the test reuse challenges specific to the reuse of nonmergeable cores, while preserving the IP aspects that are often associated with these cores. This objective is achieved through provision of a core-centric methodology that enables successful integration of cores into SoCs.IEEE Std 1500 provides a bridge between core providers and core users and also facilitates the automation of test data transfer and reuse between these two entities via the use of the IEEE P1450.6 CTL. This automation relies on information requirements (the information model) placed on the core provider to ensure that the core can be successfully integrated by the core user. The result is shorter time to market for core providers and core users.The data transfer and reuse from the core provider to the core user are based on the premise that the core test data are left unchanged, while the test protocol is adapted from the IEEE 1500 hardware interface to the SoC.",IEEE Std 1500-2005,

System performance characteristics, measured in terms of speed, reliability, suitability to a variety of purposes, and adaptability to changing technology are ultimately dependent on the particular bus structure that is used and its associated protocols.This standard defines the IEEE Std 1000 Bus, which may be used to implement general purpose, high-performance 8-bit microcomputer systems.

The recommended size for IEEE Std 1000 Bus boards is 100 mm 160 mm (3.937 in 6.299 in), commonly referred to as a single height standard depth Eurocard.The IEEE Std 1000 Bus structure is based on the master-slave concept in which a master, having gained control of the bus, may address and command slaves.

Traditionally, utility electric power systems (EPS--grid or utility grid) were not designed to accommodate active generation and storage at the distribution level. As a result, there are major issues and obstacles to an orderly transition to using and integrating distributed power resources with the grid. The lack of uniform national interconnection standards and tests for interconnection operation and certification, as well as the lack of uniform national building, electrical, and safety codes, are understood. IEEE Std 1547 and its development demonstrate a model for ongoing success in establishing additional interconnection agreements, rules, and standards, on a national, regional, and state level. IEEE Std 1547 has the potential to be used in federal legislation and rule making and state public utilities commission (PUC) deliberations, and by over 3000 utilities in formulating technical requirements for interconnection agreements for distributed generators powering the electric grid. This standard focuses on the technical specifications for, and testing of, the interconnection itself. It provides requirements relevant to the performance, operation, testing, safety considerations, and maintenance of the interconnection. It includes general requirements, response to abnormal conditions, power quality, islanding, and test specifications and requirements for design, production, installation evaluation, commissioning, and periodic tests.

This project will be complementary to IEEE 1149.4, specifically targeting parallel testing of advanced digital networks while IEEE1149.4 focuses on serial testing of more traditional analog networks. This project will also specify any software or BSDL extensions to IEEE Std. 1149.1-2001 which are required to support this new I/O test structure.","Existing boundary scan test standards (IEEE Std. 1149.1-2001, IEEE Std. 1149.4-1999) do not fully address some of the increasingly common, newer digital network topologies, such as AC-coupled differential interconnections on very high speed (1+ GBps) digital data paths. IEEE Std. 1149.1 structures and methods are intended to test static (that is, DC-coupled), single ended networks. It is unable to test dynamic (that is, AC-coupled) digital networks, since AC-coupling blocks static signals. Differential networks are also inadequately tested by the current IEEE Std. 1149.1-2001, which requires either the insertion of boundary cells between the differential driver or receiver and the chip pads (this often creates an unacceptable performance degradation), or insertion of single boundary cells before the differential driver and after the differential receiver (this reduces controllability and observability to the point that many board assembly defects cannot be detected). IEEE Std. 1149.4-1999 structures and methods are intended for testing analog networks, and in most cases are not able to test these newer digital networks as well. Specifically, IEEE Std. 1149.4-1999 provides the opportunity to inject dynamic (time varying) or analog signals for test, but these structures intended for analog testing are often too intrusive (too high an impact on performance and pin count) for high speed chip designs, and require additional resources and test application time not otherwise required for testing digital circuits. Finally, very high-speed logic imposes new restrictions on test structures that were not considered in IEEE Std. 1149.1. This project will define standard, robust, and minimally intrusive test structures and methods that provide greater detection and diagnostic capability than existing structures and methods for these classes of digital networks. The project will address the physical interface between components, the protocol for sending test data between components and the boundary scan interface. The project will also address any software and BSDL changes that are required to support this proposed standard.",IEEE Std 1149.6-2003,

The radar letter designations are consistent with the recommended nomenclature of the International Telecommunications Union (ITU). The high frequency (HF) and the very high frequency (VHF) definitions are identical in the two systems. The essence of the radar nomenclature is to subdivide the existing ITU bands, in accordance with radar practice, without conflict or ambiguity.","Since World War II, radar systems engineers have used letter designations as a short notation for describing the frequency band of operation. This usage has continued throughout the years and is now an accepted practice of radar engineers. Radar-frequency letter designations are used for the following reasons:1) They provide a convenient method for describing the band in which the radar operates without the need for awkwardly stating the limits of the frequency in numerical terms. For example, it is more convenient to say an L-band radar than a 1215 MHz to 1400 MHz radar. This is especially important in titles of published papers on radar, in advertising of radar systems and components, or in any other situation where a short notation is desired.2) In military radar systems, the exact frequency of operation cannot usually be disclosed, but it is permissible in many cases to describe the band in which it operates. The letter designations permit this.3) Each radar-frequency band has its own particular characteristics. Thus an X-band radar will be different from an S-band radar. The letter designations are often used in this manner to indicate the particular nature of the radar as it is influenced by its frequency. There are vast differences in characteristics, applications, and environmental constraints which distinguish radars in the different bands. It is the need to communicate concisely the whole set of characteristics which are shared by S-band radar, as distinguished from L-band radar, C-band radar, and the others, which requires the established usage of letter designations.",,IEEE Std 521-1984,

In particular, basic information relating to the use of this device is provided, and interpretation of measurements made using instruments based on it is considered. Two methods of measurement of spectrum amplitude and impulse bandwidth are described in detail. The first method uses a video pulse technique. The second uses a substitution method in which the reference is a pulse- modulated sine-wave generator whose parameters are measured. Both techniques are capable of about equal accuracy.","The importance of the impulse as a concept in engineering work has come about not only because of the extensive use of pulses in many types of communication systems, but also because many sources of interference or radio noise are impulsive in nature. By an impulsive source one generally means a source of electromagnetic energy which can be represented by a series of discrete disturbances of low duty cycle. Usually, it will have a relatively broad frequency spectrum. The importance of the impulse is related to the fact that where the duration of the pulse generated by a given source is sufficiently short1 in comparison with the reciprocal of the center or tuned frequency of a narrow-band network responding to it, the waveform at the output of the network is of a very definite shape practically independent of the input waveform, and has a peak value proportional to its impulse strength. Because of these relations, an impulse generator is useful for calibrating the network response, and the networks themselves may be characterized in terms of their equivalent impulse bandwidth. Because the impulse has a broad spectrum, a quantitative measure of the spectrum amplitude is also a useful quantity.",,ANSI/IEEE Std 376-1975,

Only with the interface characteristics of microcomputer devices are covered; design specifications, performance requirements, and safety requirements of modules are omitted. The use of the standard will enable independently manufactured devices to be connected into a single functional system, permit products with a wide range of capabilities to be introduced to the system simultaneously, and result in a system with a minimum of restrictions on the performance characteristics of devices connected to the system.","One of the most important elements in a computer system is the bus structure that supplies the interface for all the hardware components. This bus structure contains the necessary signals to allow the various system components to interact with each other. It allows memory and I/O data transfers, direct memory accesses, generation of interrupts, etc.This standard provides a detailed description of all the elements and features that make up the IEEE Std 796 bus.The bus supports two independent address spaces: memory and I/O. During memory cycles, the bus allows direct addressability of up to 16 megabytes using 24-bit addressing. During I/O bus cycles, the bus allows addressing of up to 64 kilobyte I/O ports using 16-bit addressing. Memory and I/O cycles can support 8-bit or 16-bit data transfers.The bus structure is built upon the masterslave concept where the master device in the system takes control of the bus and the slave device, upon decoding its address, and acts upon the command provided by the master. This handshake (master-slave relationship) between the master and slave devices allows modules of different speeds to be interface by way of the bus. It also allows data rates up to five million transfers per second (bytes or words) to take place across the bus.Another important feature of the bus is the ability to connect multiple master modules for multiprocessing configurations. The bus provides control signals for connecting multiple masters in either a serial or parallel priority fashion. With either of these two arrangements, more than one master may share bus resources.This standard has been prepared for those users who evaluate or design products that will be compatible with the IEEE Std 796 system bus structure. To this end, the necessary signal definitions and timing and electrical specifications have been covered in detail.This standard deals only with the interface characteristics of microcomputer devices, not with design specifications, performance requirements, and safety requirements of modules.Throughout this standard, the term system denotes the byte or word interface system that, in general, includes all the circuits, connectors, and control protocol to effect unambiguous data transfer between devices.

Bus bridges are enabled by the archi-tecture, but their details are beyond its scope. Configuration information is self- administered byvendors and organizations based upon IEEE Registration Authority company_id.","This is a full-use standard, a revision of ISO/IEC 13213:1994; its scope reflects accumulated experience with the CSR architecture since it was first promulgated as a standard in 1991. In the intervening years, two bus standards, Scaleable Coherent Interface (SCI), IEEE Std 1596-199x, and Serial Bus, IEEE Std 1394-1995, have been the source of most practical implementation experience. The revised scope of the CSR architecture is given below: a) The overall architectural framework partitions the total available address space into equal spaces available to individual nodes. A node's address space is in turn partitioned into regions which have different usage models, e.g., memory space, private space for vendor uses, configuration ROM and an I/O space (units space) where transactions may have side effects; b) A minimal transaction set (read, write and lock requests and their associated completion responses) required for compliant bus standards. Bus bridges compliant with this architecture, whether in a homogeneous or heterogeneous environment, are also expected to transport this transaction set; c) Fundamental control and status registers (CSRs) are defined to provide a common infrastructure for all compliant buses. In some cases the details of the registers are entirely bus-dependent but the function is common to all compliant buses; d) Message request and response CSRs are specified to enable directed delivery or broadcast of messages to multiple nodes. The message format permits organizations or vendors to define the meaning of the data payload without the need for a centralized registry of all possible formats; and e) Configuration ROM provides self-descriptive data structures that permit nodes to uniformly characterize the device services available. This is critical for buses that permit live insertion and removal of nodes; each newly inserted node contains sufficient information for it to be uniquely identified and for the requisite device drivers to be loaded. Although the original CSR architecture anticipated widespread development of bridges between heterogeneous bus standards and a diversity of addressing modes, both fixed and variable, no such implementations have been made. As a consequence, the most significant changes in scope between the earlier CSR architecture and this standard are the adoption of a single, fixed addressing model and the removal of tutorial material pertaining to the design of bridges.","The cardinal purpose of any revised standard is to correct or resolve ambiguities or deficiencies in the prior standard that have been revealed by applications (or attempted applications) of the earlier standard. This standard also preserves the following objectives of the original standard: a) Scalability. The CSR architecture is intended to be applicable to a wide range of bus standards and furthermore to a wide range of device capabilities implemented by particular products; b) Extensibility. The architecture supports contemporary processor and bus designs and, to the extent that one can anticipate the future, should be a useful framework for similar new designs. In particular, the addressing model is well suited to 32-bit and 64-bit processors. The CSR architecture creates no obstacles for the designers of adapters that bridge between common system memory and I/O buses; c) Open systems interoperability. The configuration ROM data structures, as well as the fundamental CSRs, provide tools which vendors may use to guarantee that their devices will work with each other. The segregation of one unit architecture from another tends to restrict possible adverse affects by one module, node or unit upon another; d) Manageability. The CSR architecture permits the design of systems that require little or no administration and are simple to support. Automatic configuration based upon configuration ROM is a key feature; indeed, it is essential when the applicable bus standard supports live insertion and removal of devices; and e) Parallelism. Although not directly addressed by this standard, the architecture contains no features that might preclude its use in a multiprocessor configuration. The above is a smaller set of objectives than described in ISO/IEC 13213:1994. The working group responsible for the development of this revised standard believes that its usefulness has been enhanced by restricting some of the unrealized goals of the earlier work.",IEEE Std 1212-2001 (Revision of IEEE Std 1212-1994),

This Part specifies a conceptual data schema that defines the structure of a metadata instance for a learning object. For this Standard, a learning object is defined as any entity--digital or non-digital-- that may be used for learning, education or training. For this Standard, a metadata instance for a learning object describes relevant characteristics of the learning object to which it applies. Such characteristics may be grouped in general, life cycle, meta-metadata, educational, technical, educational, rights, relation, annotation, and classification categories.

By specifying a common conceptual data schema, this Part of this Standard ensures that bindings of Learning Object Metadata have a high degree of semantic interoperability. As a result, transformations between bindings will be straightforward.

,,IEEE Std 896.9-1994,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=476640,"This standard is one in a family of Futurebus+TM standards. The Futurebus+ standards provide a set of tools with which to implement a bus architecture with performance and cost scalability over time for multiple generations of single- and multiple-bus multiprocessor systems. This standard provides fault tolerant extensions to Futurebus+ standards. As such, this standard provides the logical layer requirements for the transmission of data in a fault tolerant environment. When used in conjunction with other IEEE standards, the details to develop modular, open-architecture-based systems fulfilling user needs across a wide computing spectrum are available.","This standard specifies the functions needed to implement a fault tolerant Futurebus+TM backplane. It does not specify how to implement a fault tolerant system or how to implement a fault tolerant backplane. The functions specified are required for any system using Futurebus+ with a fault tolerant requirement. It is expected that this standard will be used in its entirety and will be cited by Futurebus+ application environment profiles requiring fault tolerance.This standard is composed of eight clauses and an annex. References required by this standard are defined in clause 2. Key words used in this standard are defined in clause 3.. Detection mechanisms (not covered by ISO/IEC 10857 :1994 and IEEE Std 896.2-1991)1 that support single-bit and single-point fault coverage are discussed in clause 4. A detailed description of error handling requirements is described in clause 5. A description of the error reports generated from the detection of an error are characterized in clause 6. Basic recovery functions (i.e., retry) are covered in clause 7. CSR definitions not covered by clause 3 of IEEE Std 896.2-1991 are specified in clause 8. The annex contains a Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA) of the signals protected by this standard.This standard is an extension of the concepts developed in ISO/IEC 10857: 1994 and IEEE Std 896.2-1991. Knowledge of those standards is necessary for a complete understanding of this standard. Because the cache coherency and message passing protocols described in ISO/IEC 10857 :1994 are built on top of the basic signaling conventions, they are beyond the scope of this standard and are not addressed by this document. However, they may be addressed by a future extension to this standard.","The high-level goal of this standard is to ensure that Futurebus+ systems requiring fault tolerance can be implemented with minimal impact on performance and costs. Specific goals supported by this standard include the following:a) No bad data is transferred across the backplane undetected; b) At a minimum, single-bit errors are detected; c) Errors are logged and reported; d) Backplane supports system halt capability after a fault is detected. It is unrealistic to consider all possible errors for fault detection. It is, however, reasonable to consider a set of errors that covers a significant portion of the possible errors. The set containing single-bit and single-point failures is considered such a set. All single-bit and single-point failures on all signal lines should be detected and reported to all modules on the bus. Without 100% detection and reporting, it is possible for an error to corrupt state information in a module on the bus without the knowledge of the module or system. While this is not ideal, it is equally unrealistic to require the detection of 100% of all single-bit and single-point failures, just as it is unrealistic to consider detection of all possible errors. It is always possible to conceive and contrive a set of circumstances that create a window of opportunity to defeat detection mechanisms. The success of detection mechanisms relies on the fact that the probability that an error may not be apparent is acceptably small. For the purposes of this standard, this probability is acceptably small if it exceeds the probability of a double-bit error. For systems requiring better fault coverage, measures beyond the scope of this standard have to be taken. The aim of the extensions specified in this standard is to establish the low-level framework that brings the fault detection, recovery, and error reporting capabilities of Futurebus+ up to the level demanded by any system that claims fault tolerance. These extensions do not establish a complete definition of a fault tolerant environment. Higher level issues, like systems with dual-redundant buses, systems using networked back-planes to achieve fault isolation, and many other configurations, are left to the system designer or to profiles. NOTE -- These goals have been formulated cooperatively and are consistent with those required by the following Futurebus+ working groups: Military, Telecommunications, and Spaceborne.",IEEE Std 896.9-1994,

Additional documents are necessary only to promote a higher degree of system level compatibility in manufacturers products.","This IEEE standard specifies the functional, electrical, and mechanical requirements for a set of signal lines that constitute a backplane bus, and for the interfacingof boards connected to that bus. The bus provides the means for the transfer of binary digital information between boards over a single backplane. The number of physical modules is restricted to 24 due to electrical and mechanical constraints, even though slot addressing allows up to 31 modules. The modules may contain any combination ofone or more processors and immediate peripherals such as memory, peripheral, and communication controllers. Figure 1 shows a block diagram of a typical board.%o connector pins are allocated for a serial bus, but the provision of such a bus is optional. The purpose of providing a serial bus would be to increase the degree offault tolerance and survivability of the system. In any high integrity system an alternate control path is required in order to prevent major system faults andallow, at least partially, orderly operation in the event of a component failure associated with the parallel bus. A serial bus is the most cost-effective way ofproviding such an alternate control path. The definition of the serial bus is outside the scope of this standard. It is anticipated that a common serial bus protocol willbe developed within the IEEE P1394 Working Group that will be applicable to all future parallel bus standards. Protocols are specified for the allocation of bus time to modules needing to conduct transactions with other modules over the bus. However, the standard does not lay down mandatory priority rules for modules to use when competing for use of the bus. These are considered the responsibility and privilege of the system implementer. The standard includes a full set of signaling rules to be followed by all modules in the distributed control acquisition process leading to bus mastership (Section 6).
