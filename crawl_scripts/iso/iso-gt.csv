3,"When the Cyber Apex Consortium contractor begins representational (open-source) architecture testing and operational architecture testing, using institution-specific parameters, (see Figure 10), different risk factors will apply. Poorly managed software integration for testing purposes has the potential to generate setbacks. Improper testing and evaluation methods could result in a cyber technology product not fully ready for deployment. The same is true of inaccurate threat modeling. _Not having deployable-ready technologies available to the customer can lead to schedule delays. _Sub-standard software performance may have the same effect. Since the NGCI Apex program will be broken up into distinct project efforts, some risks may be project dependent.

3,"Currently, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the United States Coast Guard (USCG) do not have sufficient access to surveillance sensors that provide Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA) to support USCG mission needs, nor provide coverage of remote regions. In response, the DHS Science and Technology Directorate (S&T) created The Port and Surveillance Program, with Advanced Sensor Analytics Project (ASAP) a project within the Program, which is a technology demonstration that taps the burgeoning commercial space market and government investments in fusion and analytics, to provide a capability that will enhance MDA across all of the USCG mission space. The ASAP project consists of 3 subprojects: Polar Scout, Data Analytics, and Arctic Communications. Polar Scout: Polar Scout involves the identification and development of space-based sensor feeds. The focus is identifying and leveraging existing sensors (both commercial and government) and procuring new sensors to fill MDA gaps. Polar Scout consists of an integrated system of United States Government (USG)-owned sensors (6U CubeSats) and commercial sensors (HE360 CubeSats). These sensors will be tasked to collect maritime data in support of DHS missions. The collected data is fused with weather, Automatic Identification System (AIS), air-tracks and other data to provide the DHS and the USCG with maritime situational awareness. Based on the fused information, the Polar Scout system could then request or gather information (e.g. imagery data) from other established data sources. The information received and fused within Polar Scout is then provided as input to the Data Analytics to perform additional analysis. Data Analytics: Data Analytics provides sensor exploitation enhancement of tracking, tipping, and queuing of MDA relevant objects, to support the Coast Guard and other DHS missions. The intent is to ensure that analytics performed will provide S&T with a deeper understanding of commercial space-based data sets and corresponding data correlation, predictive and prescriptive analytics.","https://www.iso.org/standard/66187.htmlhttps://www.iso.org/standard/68305.htmlhttps://www.iso.org/standard/60496.htmlhttps://www.iso.org/standard/66008.htmlhttps://www.iso.org/standard/61902.htmlhttps://www.iso.org/standard/41172.htmlhttps://www.iso.org/standard/50635.htmlhttps://www.iso.org/standard/43529.htmlhttps://www.iso.org/standard/29775.htmlhttps://www.iso.org/standard/39229.htmlhttps://www.iso.org/standard/43041.htmlhttps://www.iso.org/standard/69837.htmlhttps://www.iso.org/standard/32581.htmlhttps://www.iso.org/standard/60080.htmlhttps://www.iso.org/standard/57104.htmlhttps://www.iso.org/standard/64768.htmlhttps://www.iso.org/standard/56113.htmlhttps://www.iso.org/standard/51789.htmlhttps://www.iso.org/standard/32546.htmlhttps://www.iso.org/standard/39983.htmlhttps://www.iso.org/standard/27853.htmlhttps://www.iso.org/standard/67311.html"

3,"3.3.1 Polar Scout Trade Space AnalysisFour broad range of solutions were considered in the ASAP trade space analysis: terrestrial, maritime, airborne, and space-based. To assess the alternatives, the trade study examined a 200 by 200 NMI area 100 NM north of Barrow, Alaska, and the entire Juneau Alaska region. Each option was assessed by its ability to provide continuous coverage (24 hours per day, seven days per week) and provide a minimum of a 30 minute revisit time.Each alternative was assessed in the following areas:Platform acquisition costAccess to area of interestTechnical maturity/feasibility3.3.1.1 Preferred AlternativeWithin each solution category (terrestrial, maritime, airborne, and space-based) many potential configurations were constructed and assessed. The space-based solutions using CubeSats proved to be the optimal solution in the ability to provide a 30-minute revisit and were the least expensive alternatives. The best land-based, airborne, and maritime solutions were cost-prohibitive or had insufficient range when compared to the CubeSat space-based solution.3.3.1.2 Logistics ConsiderationsLogistics were not taken into consideration in the trade space analysis since other factors disqualified the non-CubeSat alternatives due to their high cost of acquiring the asset, access to coverage area, and technical maturity.3.3.1.3 Polar Scout Technical Approach3.3.1.3.1 Design, Development, and Integration ApproachPolar Scout is leveraging design and development activities performed under other government or commercial contracts.The 6U CubeSats have been under development for approximately 5 years by ORS. When DHS decided to leverage the ORS 6U CubeSats, the CubeSats had already passed their CDR milestone approximately two years prior. The milestones26 September 2016 Page 23 of 22monitored by DHS will be bus and payload integration activities, bus and payload test activities (e.g. thermal, environmental, etc) and ground processing activities. DHS is leveraging a payload design (by Rincon) that is currently in operations on another CubeSat. This payload will be integrated into the 6U CubeSats. The milestones monitored by DHS will be payload fabrication, payload and bus integration, payload test activities (e.g. thermal, environmental, etc), and payload processing activities. The ASAP Program Manager has decision authority of all 6U flight build, payload integration and test activities, and deviations that are directly related to the operations of the 6U CubeSats.Polar Scout is leveraging the HE360 commercial development effort to acquire additional EPIRB data. For the HE360 contract, the ASAP Program Manager has decision authority for only those design, development, and test activities related to the collection and processing of EPRIB data.A portion of the Analytics contract (RadiantBlue/HumanGeo) will be for RadiantBlue/HumanGeo to perform as the ground integrator for Polar Scout. RadiantBlue/HumanGeo will integrate the EPIRB data from both HE360 and the 6U and provide that data to the USCG and NOAA as agreed upon. To reduce cost and to further separate the Polar Scout and Analytics efforts, the ASAP project is also investigating the possibility of having Rincon integrate the EPRIB data from both the 6Us and HE360.3.3.1.3.2 Communication ApproachThe ASAP Program Manager has stood up several IPTs to monitor the Polar Scout activities. Stakeholders for the 6U CubeSat effort meet weekly in the Technical IPT and the Ground IPT. Through these two IPTs, the Polar Scout Program Manager gains insight into the status, issues, risks, and resolution of challenges. The ASAP Program Manager also has a bi-weekly technical and budget meeting with the 6U prime contractor. In addition the ASAP Program Manager conducts a status meeting with Aerospace to review project status, actions, risks, and open items.For the HE360 contract, HE360 provides monthly status and budget reports. TEMs are held approximately monthly to review the status, issues, risks, and resolution of challenges.3.3.2 AnalyticsFor the RadiantBlue/HumanGeo contract, the Program Manager meets with the team bi-weekly to review the status, issues, risks, and resolution of challenges.

3,"Current airport screening protocols rely on identification cards such as driverês licenses to perform identity verification at TSA checkpoints.  In the future, ensuring identity could be even more important if a substantial fraction of the flying public goes through an expedited screening protocol based on information (e.g., travel patterns) associated with passenger identity.  In addition, more adaptive security protocols, in which checked or carry-on baggage screening protocols are closely linked to passenger risk, would require mechanisms for high-confidence association between passengers and their bags.In this task, AF-MIT/LL will conduct a study of existing and feasible near-term identity verification and correlation methods in order to assess advantages and projected vulnerabilities with respect to potential _screening at speed” checkpoint protocols.  Components that will be considered include credential authentication technologies, standoff biometrics, scan-able unique identifiers, and the underlying software architecture and databases required to manage identity-related information.  AF-MIT/LL will perform limited implementation to support the analysis; for instance, evaluation of low-fidelity face matching to verify identity across multiple passenger visits to the same airport may require some testing with actual face images extracted from surveillance video at a range of resolutions.  The output of this task will be a set of recommendations for the use of identity verification and correlation mechanisms, and an identification of near-term development efforts required to fill capability gaps.","https://www.iso.org/standard/50867.htmlhttps://www.iso.org/standard/63637.html"
