# Contributing to ASSESS

We conduct the ASSESS project by following an agile approach.
If you want to contribute to this project, we kindly ask to refer to the following guidelines.

## Getting Started

We constantly work to design and develop high-quality software for the ASSESS technology.

[User Stories](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/UserStory.html) are chunks of desired behavior of a software system. They are widely used in agile software approaches to divide up a large amount of functionality into smaller pieces for planning purposes.

Stories are the smallest unit of work to be done for a project. The [INVEST mnemonic](https://xp123.com/articles/invest-in-good-stories-and-smart-tasks/) describes the characteristics of good stories. The goal of a story is to deliver a unit of value to the customer. 

On [GitHub](https://zube.io/blog/agile-project-management-workflow-for-github-issues/), you can make an issue the same way as you would make a story:
1. Create a new GitHub issue (you will see the suggested template for writing an issue as a user story).
2. Define a user story title and use the same as issue title.
3. Assign the priority (values 1-4 where 1 is high priory and 4 is low) to the user story and select a label accordingly (P1, P2, P3, or P4).
4. Estimate the size of the story in terms of number of iterations (i.e., weeks) needed to be accomplished.
5. Formulate the user story in the description using the "As a ... I want ... So that ..." form. The "As a" clause refers to who wants the story, "I want" describes what the functionality is, "so that" describes why they want this functionality. The "so that" part provides important context to understand to help get from what the customer think they want to providing what they actually need.
6. Provide the acceptance criteria by using the [Given-When-Then](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/gwt/) formula. Acceptance tests confirm that the story was delivered correctly.
7. Write notes about the user story.

Some issues can represent open questions (i.e., a matter not yet decided). In this case, you should not follow the aforementioned issue template, but you should just use the _question_ label to identify a GitHub issue as an open question.

You can see [the open issues of the ASSESS project](https://github.com/nasa-jpl/ASSESS/issues).

Any issue related to a specific feature can be marked with labels named as the components of the system as depicted in the following diagram.
